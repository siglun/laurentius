Data from St Laurentius Digital Manuscript Library, a service Lund
univeristy library [provided during som 15
years](https://web.archive.org/web/20120120171336/http://laurentius.ub.lu.se/). Like
so many digital library and digital humanities projects it eventually
dissappeared from the Internet.

[My thinking of the project is here](https://sigfrid-lundberg.se/2002/Laurentius/laurentius.pdf)

In addition to the RECORDS, there is a nicely formatted catalogue in
ps or pdf and the machineryt used for formatting it. It is a fairly
complex machinery implemented in xslt and GNU gtroff.

That document uses the [Kerkis
fonts](http://iris.math.aegean.gr/kerkis/) from the University at the
Egean, since there are some texts in Byzantine Greek. I have long ago
translated that font family from TeX to Groff, but it isn't clear to
that I can distribute that font giving the licensing of their
distribution, and I have very little time left for finding out.
Neither do I know if the current Kerkis 2.0 works with a modern Groff.
