Data from St Laurentius Digital Manuscript Library

This document is using the [Kerkis
fonts](http://iris.math.aegean.gr/kerkis/) from the University at the
Egean. I have long ago translated that font from TeX to Groff, but it
isn't clear to that I can distribute that font giving the licensing of
their distribution, and I have very little time left for finding out.
