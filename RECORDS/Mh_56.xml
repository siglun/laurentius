<physDesc>
    <support><p>Paper</p><watermarks><p>There are two groups of watermarks: 4 watermarks dating to late 15th - early 16th and 2 watermarks dating to 18th century: 1) a single-handed pot with a crown and a quatrefoil, close to Briquet 12626 (1500) and 12627 (1511), appears most frequently throughout the manuscript (see e.g. f. <locus>152</locus>); 2) coat-of-arm with three fleur-de-lis and a letter "C" below the shield, close to Piccard 1794 (1517), appears in the second half of the manuscript and possibly on the leaf VII on f. <locus>468r</locus> (the mark is not comparable to others due to the thickness of the paper to which the leaf is attached) (se e.g. f. <locus>401</locus>); 3 and 4) the letter P with a crossbar and a bifurcated foot, appears on three leaves in two, slightly different, versions: the first one (f. <locus>458</locus>)  is close to Briquet 8581 (1490), the second (ff. 461, 462) is close to Briquet 8580 (1500) and Licacev 1195 (1482/3). Watermarks from the second group appear on some of the added leaves and the upper flyleaf: 1) rampant, crowned lion holding arrows and a torch (?) on a pedestal with an inscription (probably <q>VRIJHEID</q>), all within a triple-line circle with a caption <q>PRO PATRIA EIUSQUE LIBERTATE</q>; above the circle
there is a crown and a tree. The watermark appears on the first upper flyleaf, close to Heawood 3151 (1769); 2) a crowned shield charged with a fleur-de-lis and with the letters <q>WR</q> and the figure 4 in a monogram below. The watermark appears on ff. 298 and 332, close to Piccard 1362 (1755).</p>

<collation><p>Collation is disturbed due to the rebounding of the manuscript and the restoration of the leaves in the 1980s. However the quires are generally quaternions. No catchwords or quire signatures. The manuscript contains a number of added leaves from different periods (presumably up till 18th century): f. 2a (between ff. 2 and 3, ±181x59 mm), p. 135a (attached to f. 65r, 180x40 mm), f. 75a (between ff. 74 and 75, 220x139 mm), f. 298 (see the watermark, the leaf is attached to f. 297, ±334x 246 mm), f. 332 (see the watermark, the leaf is attached to f. 333,  ±345x260 mm), ff. 465-468 (7 leaves foliated I-VII, see the watermark, p. I - in fragments, glued on modern paper under the restoration of the MS, writing only on one side, ±320x195 mm). Ff. 75a, 465-468 (I-VII) have been glued directly on the original leaves (ff. 75r, 428r-431r) and taken off during the rebinding of the MS, the leaves contain glue marks.</p>
</collation>

<layout><p>Ruling in hard point filled with pencil; only in pencil on the attached leaves. The layout is homogeneous throughout practically the whole manuscript: 1 column, 8 lines and music, with exception for ff. 455r-457v: 1 column, 12-14 lines and music; and ff. 459r - 464v: 2 columns, 23 lines.</p></layout>

<msWriting hands="4">
<handDesc><p>Textualis Quadratus, Textualis Semiquadratus. Roman square note script. Four hands. Hand 1 on ff. 1-427v (inc: hominum simul in unum; expl: christo domino evovae); hand 2 on ff. 428r-457v? (rubric: Per totum adventum. ad tertiam ymnus; inc: Conditor alme syderum; expl: que sola virgo parturit?); hand 3 on ff. 458r-v (inc: hec vota clemens accipe; expl: Deus creator omnium); hand 4 on ff. 459r-464v (rubric: Dominicis diebus; inc: Domine miserere nostri; expl: iherusalem laudem in terra). The script on the added leaves (ff. 75a, 298v and 332r-v as well as on the small slip paginated 135a) is similar to Antiqua typeface or Humanistic minuscule (no abbreviations). The script on leaves 465r-468r has the similar appearance but contains a great number of abbreviations. The script on the slip f. 2a-v is in a later hand.</p></handDesc>

<history>
<origin><p>The MS originates most probably from a Benedictine nun monastery called Ghislenghien, 1126-1796, situated in Hagenau province in Flanders, between the towns of Enghien and Ath. Judging from the addendum in the text, watermarks on the added leaves and so on, the MS has been in use until the 18th century.</p></origin>

<provenance><p>Note in the centre of the upper flyleaf: <q>Heberles Cat. ? LXXIV</q>, probably made in the period after the MS had left the monastery and
 before it came to Sweden. In upper right corner of the upper flyleaf: <q>Gustaf Noring 1877</q>; in pencil below (unidentified hand) <q>= numera Ali Nuri Bey, muhamedan. Turk. generalkonsul i Rotterdam, föll i onåd hos sultanen och förvisades till mindre Asien 1899(?)</q>. Gustaf Noring (b. 1861 (according to
 other sources 1858) - d. 1937) was a Swedish book collector from Malmö, who immigrated to Turkey in 1879, became a Turkish diplomat, embraced Islam and changed his name to Ali Nouri Bey. According to what he says in his own book ("Ur gamla gömmor, En gärd åt det förflutna af Ali Nouri", Malmö Tidning 1902 8/4, printed in 20 copies, see Carlander C.M. "Svenska bibliotek och exlibris", Stockholm 1904, pp. 429-30, 760-61) Noring had a book collection of about 5000 volumes by the time he left Sweden at the age of 16 (or 19). In 1879 part of his collection was sold. This manuscript was probably among the sold books. The manuscript appears in catalogues from Quidings Antiqvariat (Lund) from 1883 (Katalog ? 3. Teologi och Kyrkohistoria, #442, priced at 75 Swedish crowns) and from 1886 (Katalog ? 11. Teologi och Kyrkohistoria, #1734, priced at 50 Swedish crowns). It is not included in the next catalogue (December 1891).</p>

<acquisition><p>The manuscript arrived at Lund university library 16 November 1926 
as part of Professor A. W. Quennerstedt's estate (1837-1926, professor of zoology at the University of Lund).</p>
