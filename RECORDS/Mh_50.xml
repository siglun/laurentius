      <binding><p>Reversed whittawed leather binding, contemporary with the
	  manuscript. Size: 315 x 230 x 45 mm.</p> 
	<p>Reversed whittawed leather binding over rounded beech boards. The
	  covering is worn, partly torn and missing at the spine. A piece of
	  parchment manuscript waste with seven initials in alternating red or
	  blue with restricted pen flourishes in opposite colour has been used
	  for later repair of the back. The parchment is torn, defect and does
	  not hold to the spine. Traces of two lost metal fastenings at
	  fore-edge. Trimmed edges. Pastedowns of parchment, detached from
	  boards. The joints are repaired by large hinges of parchment
	  strips. Endbands missing. All along packed sewing on four double
	  leather thongs laced through the boards. All sewing supports are
	  cracked in the joints except one of the lower board.</p>
