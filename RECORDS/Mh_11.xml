    <decoration>
      <decoNote><p>The decoration is restricted to initials, with illuminated
	  initials marking the beginning of each book, except for book IV,
	  described below; and numerous (approximately 150 two line initials in
	  red or blue with comparatively modest pen flourishes in the
	  complementary colour, including perpendicularly chained rows of
	  I-initials in alternating colours.</p> 
	<p>Detailed description:
	  f. <locus>1r</locus>: Illuminated initial G, in blue with white
	  roundels, inscribed in a gilt frame with light red background, one
	  serif protruding in upper margin. The initial is inhabited by a small
	  dragon, the body of which is facing left, with head turned backwards
	  and tail curled in a spiral; 
	  f. <locus>69r</locus>: Illuminated initial E in pink with deoration
	  in white inscribed in a gilt frame against a blue background. The
	  filling is made up of symmetrically organized leaf ornaments in blue,
	  gold, pale green and small white dots against a red background; 
	  f. <locus>115r</locus>: Illuminated initial F in pink with cross
	  patterns in white and gold, with a parallell staff in blue. The lower
	  half of the staff  is constituted by a small blue dragon with white
	  head biting the letter, the tail of which ends, together with the red
	  background field, in a curling leaf pattern with gilt roundels. The
	  filling of the initial is inhabited by two symmetrically arranged
	  blue dragons with leaf decoration and gilt roundels against a red
	  background; 
	  f. <locus>153</locus>: Illuminated initial P in ble with white
	  decoration inscribed in a gilt frame against a pink background. Staff
	  ends with a small pink dragon biting the letter, the tail of which
	  ends in a curling leaf pattern with the small blue background
	  strip. The filling of the initial consists of two pink twigs, rather
	  than dragons, but with a common head en face against a dark blue
	  background.</p> 
	<p>Style: The script and the illuminations are of a fairly common type,
	  but never the less of a high quality, suggesting perhaps a Parisian
	  origin, showing the closest affinities with the works of Gautier
	  Lebaube, Johannes Grusch and the Soissons atelier. A date not long
	  after ca. 1250 seems most likely.</p>

<history>
    <origin><p>In the will of dean Bent of August 23, 1285 (DD, II, 150) the
	Decretum Gratiani is given to canon Henrik, the Summa Raimondi to
	Odder, the Comment to the Epistles of St Paul to Peder, priest in
	Åkarp, an Itinerary (Breviary) to <q>thye pebbling Oluf</q>, and to
	Niels Gregerson the Summa of Goffredus, possibly identical to
	Medeltidshandskrift 11.</p>
