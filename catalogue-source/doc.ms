f. 23r :
Full page decoration with a combination of four separate rubricated diagrams within a common decorated frame,
illustration to II:54:9. Above left Geometrica,
a diagram with a horizontal band divided into four with two concentric segments of a circle above,
the outer of which connects the outermost fields,
and the inner,
which is divided by a vertical line,
connects the two central fields,
and below two intersecting segments connecting the outer fields with the central field in the opposite half of the horizontal band.
Above right Arithmetica,
a diagram with a horizontal band divided into four with two concentric segments of a circle above,
the outer of which connects the outermost fields,
and the inner,
which is divided by a vertical line,
connects the two central fields,
and below a larger segment connecting the far left field with the central right,
and a smaller segment connecting the far right field with the central right.
Below left Armonica,
a diagram with a horizontal band divided into two bands of which the upper is divided into four fields with two concentric segments of a circle above,
the outer of which connects the outermost fields,
and the inner,
which is divided by a vertical line,
connects the two central fields.
The lower band is divided into two and two arches connect the outer parts of the fields with the division line in the middle.
Below right Consonantiae,
a diagram with a vertical band divided into four with a large segment of a circle to the left connecting the outer fields and three smaller segments connecting the respectively juxtaposed fields.
To the right two intersecting segments connect the outer fields with the central field in the opposite half of the vertical band.
The diagrams are separated from each other by a cruciform decoration consisting of two parallel lines transgressing the frame and ending with knobbed sprouts which diverge in the vertical axis,
and intersect in the horizontal axis,
and a secondarily enhanced cross inscribed between these lines with knobs at the ends and in the center.
Short knobbed sprouts of the same kind protrude from the corners of the frame.
.PP
In comparison with the luxurious Bamberg manuscript of De Arithmetica,
Bamberg Staatsbibliothek,
Class.
8 (H.J.IV.12), there is a marked absence of independent artistry in Medeltidshandskrift 1.
The simplicity of the diagrammatic decoration presents us with a neutral complement to the text,
common also in astronomical and geometrical treatises throughout the Middle Ages,
without any stylistic features connecting the decoration with the art historical currents of eastern France to which the manuscript has been ascribed on palaeographical grounds,
or any other region.
There is reason to believe that the attitude towards the diagrams as part of the text rather than images justified an exact copying of the exemplar instead of an interpretation in the taste of the day,
which makes the only decorated illustration the more interesting.
.PP
The full page diagram on f.
23r displays characteristic protrusions in the framework.
Though simple in design they are distinct enough to say that they do not convey to the notion of either Franco-Saxon style in particular or late Carolingian style as a whole,
but show closer affinities to insular decoration.
The spelling and abbreviations in the Lund manuscript noted by Lehmann seem to confirm the textual dependence of an insular prototype.
Parallels to the frame in this manuscript are to be found in the evangelist portraits in the Trier Gospels and the Macregol Gospels.
In detail,
however,
insular book illumination often show a more elaborated interlace pattern,
whereas the simpler kind of knobbed sprouts are found in late antique works of art in different media.
.PP
In comparison to diagrams and schemas in related works on the liberal arts by Cassiodorus and the Corpus Agrimensorum,
with which De Arithmetica was often associated,
there is a striking similarity in execution independent of the manuscript's date or place of origin.
In the case of the Corpus Agrimensorum,
which is preserved in both 6th century manuscripts and later copies,
it can be stated that the Carolingian artists followed their exemplars very closely.
Suggesting that the same can be suspected of the relation between Medeltidshandskrift 1 and its prototype,
it is likely that its decoration represents a faithful copy ultimately derived from a 6th century exemplar without extensive alterations.
.PP
The mediatory role played by the insular monasteries during the 7th and 8th centuries to promote classical learning is well known,
and De Arithmetica was translated by Alfred the Great in the 9th century.
Considering the convincing late antique character of the framework on f.
23r it seems plausible that an insular 8th century copy of a late antique prototype was the immediate exemplar of Medeltidshandskrift 1.
.PP
The importance of the monastery of Fleury in the dissemination of Boethius texts,
and the contacts between Fleury and English monasteries during the 10th century are well documented,
and preserved late carolingian copies from its scriptorium such as e.g. the Codex Schoenbergianus have many features in common with Medeltidshandskrift 1.
Hypothetically,
thus, Fleury is perhaps the most likely point where different tendencies as the Carolingian script,
the classical layout and the insular spelling converge.
.PP
The combination of the diagrams on f.
23r form the picturing of the "maxima et perfecta symphonia,
quae tribus distenditur interuallis" which is the subject of II:54. The concept,
based on Timaios of Plato and De Caelo of Aristotle,
is set in a Christian context by Boethius and becomes a parallel to the concordance of the gospels,
the "evangelical harmony". The similarity of the setup of the Boethius page to the cruciform pages with all four evangelist symbols in The Book of Kells,
The Trier Gospels and the Macdurnan Gospels cannot be ignored.
In the light of the arian conflict at the time of Boethius,
the emphasis on symphonia as opposed to differentia gives a profound theological dimension to the mathematical treatise,
an idea procurred by Boethius also in his text De Trinitate.

The manuscript contains 360 preserved decorated initials divided into three categories:
a) two 8-10 line-initials,
decorated with white vine stems and flower buds against multicoloured background;
mark the beginning of the two main parts of the text:
on f. 1r : Proprium de tempore,
and on f.
57v : Proprium sanctorum.
b) six 4-6 line-initals,
decorated with simple white vine stems against multicoloured background;
mark the beginning of certain texts of special solemnity.
c) 352 initials of standard size in square capitals against a background of separated multicoloured fields,
often with simple geometrical decoration.
Three initials are missing between f.
32 and 33.

f. 1r : Large initial (F) of type a.
Red outline drawing,
bakground and details in blue,
green and yellow.
The stem is built up of a double shaft plated with alternating blue and green bands,
both parts of which continue in the tvärstaplar and twist around themselves and extends to foliated scrolls in the fields around the tvärstaplar.
Begins the proprium de tempore by the reading of Dominica prima de aduentu domini "Fratres!
Scientes quia hora est"; f. 1v : initial (F) of type c in silver against a background of red and green.
Begins the reading of Dominica iii de aduentu domini "Fratres.
Sic nos existemet"; f. 27v :
Gilded initial (I) of type c.
Begins the reading of Feria vi.
post dominicam in passione "Hieremias In diebus illis dixit hieremias Domine omnes qui te derelinquunt confundentur"; f. 28r :
Gilded initial (F) of type b.
Red outline drawing,
stem in gold with three branches in silver against a background in green,
red and blue.
Begins the reading of the mass at Dominica palmarum "Fratres!
Hoc sentite in uobis"; f. 33r :
offprint from initial (F) of type b from the verso page of a lost preceeding folio,
estimated hight 6-8 lines;
the contents of the lost folio included the texts from Sabbato sanctae paschae,
lectio Isaye prophete.
Sine titulo "Hec est hereditas" to Feria iii post pasche lectia actuum apostolorum "In diebus illis:
Surgens Paulus". On top of f.
33r "in eum" are the last words of the reading In feria ii post pasche "In diebus illis stans Petrus in medio plebis". The initial began the reading In die sancto pasche ad missam "Fratres.
Expurgate vetus fermentum". The offprint shows that parts of the initial were in silver which in analogy to the initial on f.
28r and its offprint on f.
27v , suggests that remaining parts would have been gilded.
Considering the position of the initial on Easter day Mass,
this is not surprising.
The only visible parts of the initial display a flower bud in the upper left corner,
and leaves twisting around the tvärstaplar of the F;
f. 34v :
4-line initial (F), simple white vine stem against blue and green background.
Begins Dominica octava paschae "Fratres.
Omne quod natum est"; f. 35v :
6-line initial (K) simple white vine stem against blue,
green and yellow background.
Begins Dominica iii post octava paschae "Karissimi.
Omne datum optimum"; f. 36r :
6-line initial (K) simple yellow coloured white vine stem against blue and green background.
Begins Dominica iiii post octava paschae "Karissimi.
Estote factores uerbi"; f. 36v :
6-line initial (P) simple white vine stem against blue,
green and yellow background.
Begins In die ascensionis domini "Primum quidem sermonem"; f. 39v :
5-line initial (D), white vine stem with knot around the curve against blue,
green and yellow background.
Begins Die pentecosten "Dum conplerentur dies pentecostes"; f. 57r :
the reading for Dominica ultima post trinitatem,
here called Dominica v ante natalem domini,
is incomplete.
It ends with Hieremias "Ecce dies ueniunt dicit dominus", which should have been followed by Isaiah 10:22-27, possibly originally placed on the missing first folio.
Compare with Medeltidshandskrift 5 where the end of this reading precedes the reading of Dominica iiii ante natiuitate Domini;
f. 57v :
large 8-line initial (D) of type a.
Red outline drawing with a horizontally symmetrical arrangement of white vine stem filling the center without transgressing the limitations of the letter with the exception of two leaves twisting around the staff.
Two small flower buds make the serifs and the branch forks are indicated by series of short strokes.
Begins the proprium sanctorum:
Idus decembris natale sanctae Luciae "Domine deus meus". As the reading for Sta Lucia on f.
1r is followed by St.
Thomas and St.
Sylvester,
and St.
Andreas on f.
72v is followed by both Sta.
Barbara and the octave of St.
Andreas,
the order does not coincide either with the astronomical or the usual ecclesiastical calendar,
but must be understood as a significant deviation in order to emphasize the position of Sta.
Lucia.
In Medeltidshandskrift 5,
the other Lundensian epistolary,
for comparison,
the proprium sanctorum begins with St.
Sylvester and ends with St.
Andreas,
whereas the reading for Sta.
Lucia is anonymously entered under the common rubric De virginibus.
.PP
Style:
Ewert Wrangel has suggested a south German origin based on general assumptions concerning Romanesque white vine stem decoration.
Per Ekström noted the names of Ursmar and Lambert,
and questioned the manuscript's local origin,
i.e. liturgical use,
but without giving an alternative place of production.
Though the buds and the disposition of the leaves are clearly derived from late ottonian and salian decoration,
the particular inward curled floral ornaments are not usually found in German book illumination of the 12th century,
but are rather reminescent of the 11th century manuscripts from the scriptoria at Gembloux and Lobbes.
Also the backgrounds with contrasting bright colours are common in early Romanesque Flemish manuscripts.
The style is totally coherent with the Flemish elements of the liturgical apparatus,
which in combination give a fairly narrow frame of attribution.
The place of origin is undoubtedly located in the see of Liège,
with the highest probability in Lobbes or Gembloux if not Rolduc itself.
Provided that Heriman of Schleswig is the intermediary link or even the commissioner,
the terminus post quem is given by the foundation of Rolduc in 1104 and the terminus ante quem by Heriman's leaving Rolduc in 1129.
.PP
Numerous fragments from a 12th century missal (now Fragm.
93) taken from the secondary binding of Medeltidshandskift 7 (Liber daticus) show the same initials against a background of multicoloured fields and a very similar script to that of Medeltidshandskrift 2,
suggesting a common origin.

sometimes cropped.
The amount of missing text from the first quires (cfr. above) corresponds to a loss of the outer bifolium of the quire.
Apart from this loss,
the remaining loop of sewing thread and fragments of parchment still visible behind two supports,
indicate the loss of another,
unsigned,
quire consisting of a single bifolium.
Since the writing space required for the text of the first psalm,
including a large B-initial,
and the beginning of the second is supplied by the missing first folio of the first preserved quire,
the superfluous amount of leaves provided by the extra bifolium would have sufficed to use the first leaf as pastedown,
leaving one folio for prefaces or decorations.
One quire is missing between f.75 and f.
76. The text ends corruptly on f.
149v and fragments of sewing hamp indicate the loss of one quire,
probably a single bifolium.

The 155 initials,

are simple but not without elegance in the curvature and sometimes decorated with small leaves and flower buds.
Generally the initials are in uncial,
but there are a few square initials,

Secondary enhancements in light brown ink with floral ornaments and geometrical designs on ff.
4r, 69r, 76r, 110r,

the light brown outline of a bearded face in profile in the left margin marking a section of the commentary,

One secondary illumination,

b) 7 initials with an ondulated line along the stem (ff. 1r , 32r ,

or other kind of decoration indicating days of special solemnity described below.
In the secondary portion of the manuscript,

f. 70r :
initial (F) for Cena Domini,
blue with double ondulated line and tail leaf ornament in red;
f. 73r :
initial (I) for Sabbato sancto,
blue and red with dividing ondulated line and parallell line in the red area,
protruding leaf ornament at tail in blue and red and leaf ornament in red at top serif,
left side is furnished with bordure (smerlato) decoration;
f. 77v :
a framed column-width illumination covering the lower two thirds of the written space,
depicting Maiestas Domini seated on a cushioned throne with right hand raised slightly turned inwards in a blessing gesture,
and left hand resting on a book placed on his left knee.
The proportionately big head,
the childish hair dress and the evasive gaze renders the figure of Christ a rather modest stature,
the intimacy of which is further stressed by the limited space allowed by the perspective frame.
The soft folds of the dress are delicately drawn in alternating black and greyish blue lines,
although a substantial part of the blue pigments have flaked off and been replaced in modern time.
The frame consists of concentric bands in (outside inwards) bright green,
gold, mauve with simple floral ornaments in white,
gold and blue.
The lower part of the inner frame is orange with small circles and arches in white,
suggesting a footstool with an architectural structure.
There are no traces from any precedent illumination.
The page was most probably not originally decorated (cfr. f. 72v ); f. 78r :
initials (F, F, I) for Die Paschae,
originally monocoloured in red with foliated fillings and extended tails.
Secondarily enhanced with dark blue with white floral decoration and burnished gold on raised gesso ground;
f. 92r :
initial (I) for Die Pentecosten,
blue with double ondulated lines and leaf ornament at tail;
f. 152r :
small initial (I) for Vigilia omnium sanctorum,
blue simple letter with bordure decoration in red along left side.
.PP
Style:
The miniature on f.
77v has previously been dated to the 12th century in the literature.
It has been used to corroborate a dating of byzantinizing reliefs from Lund Cathedral to the 1140:s, and to provide proof of early romanesque lundensian book illumination.
However,
the dark blue pigments and the gold on gesso ground used in the miniature are identical to the secondary initials of the opposite page,
f. 78r .
These initials are clearly altered compared to their original monocoloured appearance.
A close parallell to the miniature is presented by the Maiestas Domini in the Book of Horne,
now in the Danish National Museum,
which shows the same,
though more intricate,
composition of the frame,
throne and gestures.
The multiple frame with gilt central panel,
delicate white floral ornaments in the blue field outside the central panel,
the composition of the throne and the posture of Christ,
his hair with almost circular contour and sliding down his left shoulder,
the short beard with marked strokes flanking the thin mouth all present striking similarities between the two manuscripts.
Also the discrepancies can be accounted for.
The somewhat illogically curved edges of the throne in Medeltidshandskrift 5 can hardly be derived directly from the bowl-like construction of the upper part of the throne in the Maiestas-picture in the Horne-Book, but is on the other hand totally coherent with the construction of the bench in the portrait of St.
Mark in the Horne-Book. In both manuscripts the same small window-openings of the oblique plane in front of the throne can be observed,
and the suppedaneum which is present in the Horne-Maiestas,
is lacking in Medeltidshandskrift 5 and the Horne-Mark. Although the general appearance of the figures is very similar,
there are few exact matches as to the folds,
but a comparison between the folds on Christ's right arm and right half of the torso in the two manuscripts,
show identical composition.
A prominent feature in this manuscript,
but lacking in the Horne-Book, is the double contour with thin black and white lines close together.
In Danish book-illumination it is frequently used in the "Naestved Calendar", Copenhagen,
Det Kongelige Bibliotek,
E don.
var. 52 2o,
dating from 1228-50, in which the same folds on the lower hems occur as here,
as well as gilt central panels.
The similarities are not,
however,
close enough to attribute the two manuscripts to the same workshop.
The gradation from light to dark mauve-brown in the halo in Medeltidshandskrift 5 has its counterpart in the halo of St.
Nicolaus in the Horne-Book. The small black eyes with pupils turned sideways,
are not identical with the frontal gaze of the Horne-Maiestas but occur in all of the evangelist-portraits,
and is iconographically motivated.
These circumstances make it probable that the artist of Medeltidshandskrift 5 has turned to the evangelist-portrait in the Horne-Book rather than to the Maiestas for the details in order to adapt the figure of the Majestas to a smaller format.
It is not likely that the Horne-Book was produced by a Danish artist,
but it must be emphasized that,
if it were executed around 1220 in northern Germany,
it was probably made in an area occupied by Denmark,
or by a German artist active in Denmark,
on comission to the Scanian monestary of Bosjö.
The miniature in Medeltidshandskrift 5 is undoubtedly a direct paraphrase of the Horne-Maiestas made by an artist,
connected to Lund cathedral,
in front of the Horne-Book, with details copied and assembled from different miniatures in the Horne-Book shortly after the fire in 1234,
when the Horne-Book still must have been regarded as very much up to date.
.PP
In comparison to the mural paintings in the south transept of Lund cathedral from the time of restauration after the fire under archbishop Uffe Thrugotsen (1228-52), known only through watercolour drawings from the 1830:s, but clearly reminescent of the mural paintings in the church of Åhus dating from the mid 13th century,
the transitional style of Scanian painting is consistent enough to suspect the Maiestas-miniature in Medeltidshandskrift 5 to be the product of a Scanian school of illumination during the mid 13th century.
.PP
The reading for St.
Andrew on f.
155v was repeated on the flyleaf in the late 15th or early 16th century,
suggesting a continuous use of the manuscript at the altar of St.
Andrew in Lund cathedral,
which was inaugurated in 1303 by the dean Andreas,
with a special endowment for the restauration of the books.
A date of the miniature between the fire in 1234 and the restauration of the church,
which according to the colophon of a diploma of 1241,
was partly in use at that time,
is historically motivated and in accordance with the style.
.PP
Iconography:
The blessing gesture of Maiestas Domini,
with the hand facing sideways,
and the evasive gaze reoccur in byzantine art from the late 12th century onwards,
and it is likely that the prototype was introduced to Germany after the fourth crusade,
1204.

\& The memoriale,
according to Weibull the nucleus of the book,
is in the form of a calendar,
a work of many hands (27 identified by Weibull,
p. xcv), where in general 5 lines have been reserved for each day.
It was drawn up in 1123 for the inauguration of the crypt.
The oldest annotations were copied from an older memoriale (from after 1074,
cfr. Weibull,
p. xlvii). Sporadic hands appear as late as 1316 (Weibull,
p. lvii); see Weibull,
pp. xcv-xcix, the diagram "Händerna i Memoriale fratrum". [\fIDiplomatarium Danicum.

Decoration
.small
.PP
Two large illuminated and inhabited initials by different artists on ff.
5v and 58v ,
15 decorated initials in red,
or occasionally blue,
ink with leaf ornaments or bordure decoration (ff. 9v , 10r ,
11v , 14v ,
15v , 17r ,
21r , 22r ,
40r , 83r ,
92r , 93r ,
110r ,
118v ,
119v) and numerous monocoloured initials in red,
blue or green.
Generally each different text begins with a decorated initial,
but no difference in importance between decorated and plain initials is marked within the texts.
The initial (F) on f.
11v combining leaf ornament and bordure decoration stands out as larger.
The smaller initials of the Aachen rule are undecorated with the exception of two intials with serifs ending in small lilies (ff. 62v ,
66v ). The initials on ff.
5v , 9v , 14v ,
17r , 18r ,
26r , 89r ,
105r ,
110r ,
112r ,
113r ,
118r ,
123r are clearly overlapping the text,
showing that the initials were executed after the text.
In the portion of the Aachen rule,
no such overlappings are visible,
and it can not be determined whether the division of the script on either side of the tail of the initial (Q) on f.
58v is due to a planned composition prior to the text or as a result of the already present tail of the initial,
although in general it is more likely that the initial is later than the text.
In the Memoriale fratrum each month is headed by a KL monogram in red and blue (ff. 124v ,
128v ,
132r ,
136r ,
140r ,
144r ,
148r ,
152r ,
158r ,
162r ,
166r ,
170r ). Letter-fillings in second colour (ff. 58r ,

f. 5v : large inhabited initial (A) of uncial type,
7 lines high in red outline drawing against a blue background delicately following the contours of the initial,
except on the right side.
The strapped stem ends with interlace on top and an overturned leaf at the bottom.
The bow of the letter is constituted by a slender short-winged dragon in profile,
biting the stem,
by which the lower cheek of the dragon in turn is pierced,
its tail ending in a second head from the mouth of which leaves protrude.
Foliage,
winding from the lower end of the stem,
fills the space below the dragon and is pierced through the dragon's neck and through itself in three instances.
Small leaves of the white vine stem-type, one large symmetrical three-petalled leaf and three bunches of grapes drawn as a rombic grid with a short stroke in the centre of each compartment,
rendering the grapes the shape of hop or pineapple;

The panelled body of the letter is furnished with two broad bands heightened in yellow and four dotted strips.
At the top and the bottom the inner part of the panels continues in loops of white vine stems dividing in smaller intersecting loops and ending in leaves and grapes.
The upper loop is inhabited by an eagle,
the lower by a lion,
their bodies turned left and heads turned back,
biting in the foliage.
The tail of the letter is dividing the text and designed as a snake with the body decorated with brown and red stars and tied in a knot.
Its head with outstreched tongue is turned forward and a collar of loose skin is dragging behind horisontally as if the dragon was shedding it;

Style:
The two initials are without doubt executed by different artists.
The initial (A) on f.
5v is executed by an indigenous artist.
It demonstrates typical Scandinavian features as the pierced animal motif found on runic stones and,
closer in style,
on the earlier Danish golden altar-frontals from Lisbjerg and Broddetorp,
as well as in a carved lion on the key stone of the eastern arch of the middle vault in the crypt of Lund Cathedral.
Also the grapes depicted as a rombic grid between symmetrical leaves,
similar to hop,
occur in Danish early 12th century art in different media.
Except for the golden altar-frontals mentioned,
the motif is especially common in Jutish stone sculpture.
(cfr. Dorte Lorentzen Belling,
"Gennemstukne dyr", Romanske stenarbejder 2,
Moesgård 1984,
pp. 155 - 176). The dragon,
with its slender body and headed tail,
can be compared to the two affronted dragons on the north corbel of the north crypt entrance at Lund cathedral,
but without any further affinities.
The Scandinavian features have been adopted to the German idiom of intersecting white vine-stem decoration with red details against a blue background,
suggesting a Scandinavian artist schooled in a German monastic environment.
The initial is perhaps the only surviving example of the highly cultivated lundensian school of book illumination from the 12th century.
.PP
The initial (Q) on f.
58v is a fine example of an early but not pioneering stage of the german romanesque white vine-stem initials,
with distinct and logically intersecting loops and twigs without being crowded.
The leaves are variegated and the three-petalled end-leaves are smaller than in the previous initial,
the grapes distinctly shaped as bunches of separate circles.
The eagle and the lion are skilfully placed overlapping,
and overlapped by,
twigs without obscuring the motif.
The general appearance of the initial is frequently repeated through the 12th century in all of Germany and Flanders,
but the stage of development correspond to decorative traditions in Northern and Northwest Germany from the beginning of the 12th century.
Similar features are found mainly in Cologne,
Trier,
Paderborn and surrounding areas.
Wrangel (p. 90) suggested a Cologne origin,
but considering the historical circumstances at the time of production of Medeltidshandskrift 6,
it is tempting to see connections to the known established association to Helmarshausen,
from which two lavishly illuminated Gospel books made for Lund cathedral are preserved (Uppsala,
Ms. C 83 & Copenhagen,
Det Kongelige Bibliotek,
Ms. Thott 21). The somewhat archaic appearance of the script,
in the tradition of late salian minuscule,
is datable to c.
1100 and can hardly be considered contemporary with the clearly romanesque character of the initial.
A tentative interpretation of this,
here presumed,
discrepancy indicates that the initial is likely to have been executed when the preface to the Aachen rule was added on.
f. 58r ,
probably shortly before 1123.
Whereas the script is comparable to some of the hands in Trier,
Dombibl.
Ms. 138 and 139,
made in Helmarshausen c.
1100, the initial is closer to Trier,
Dombibl.
Ms. 62, dating from the middle of the 12th century.
The initials in Trier,
Ms. 62 are rather more developed than Medeltidshandskrift 6 though,
and certain aspects such as the lion repeating the posture of f.
54v in Trier,
Ms. 139, point to a middle position in the development.
.PP
Iconography:
The two-headed dragon in the white-vine foliage of the first initial is a common motif,
not to be specifically related to the following text.
In some cases texts by Basilius have been illustrated as a pun with a basilisc.
Despite the fact that the dragon in Medeltidshandskrift 6 is two-headed,
there is no trace of a cockscomb,
defining the animal as a basilisc.
The dragon in connection with the vine and grapes,
is to be interpreted as the snake (cfr. the greek "drakon") in the garden of Eden.
The eagle and lion on f.
58v , interpreted by Wrangel (p. 87) as evangelist symbols,
are more probably allegorical representations in general,
illustrating aspects of Christ conquering the snake,
weakened by the knot.

Origin
.small
.PP
The manuscript belonged to the Cathedral in Lund and was drawn up in 1123 for the inauguration of the main altar of the crypt.
It was in continuous use until 1145 when,
in conjuntion with the inauguration of the high altar in the choir of the upper church,
it was succeeded by a new record book:
Medeltidshandskrift 7,
the so called Liber daticus vetustior.
Notes were being copied though from the Liber daticus into the Necrologium (last datable note is from Oct.
1316) but there are also occasional notes from as late as early 16th century.

The manuscript entered the library in 1671 when the chapter was formally reorganized,
or dissolved,
and its manuscripts were transferred to the University library.

Style:
The grand KL-monograms with their intricate and highly organically rendered foliage is not coherent with any manuscript decoration known to have been executed in Scandinavia.
Ewert Wrangel (Lunds domkyrkas konsthistoria,
1923, pp. 103-110) suggests a south German or Bohemian origin,
but without any convincing comparisons,
while in a foot note he refers to his friend Wilhelm Köhler,
who suggests a northern French origin.
Exceptionally close affinities are in fact found in the north east of France.
The scriptoria of Corbie,
Metz and Reims all present plausible places of origin with a tendency towards Metz on hagiographical grounds,
or Reims for ecclesiogeographical reasons (see Origin).

There are marginal notes pertaining to the first 8 months of the year,
in one hand from the early 15th century.
The notes give editorial directions like "non scribatur" or "summarie habetur in alio libro et sic scribendum est,
non hic set V kl.
Mart.", or "scribatur ut in alio libro". Langebek presumed that this "other book", referred to is the so called Liber daticus recentior (Copenhagen,
Kungliga Bibliteket,
Gl. kgl. Saml.
Nr. 845). Weeke is not convinced and instead hypothesizes another contemporary necrology,
now lost.

Origin
.small
.PP
Metz,
early 12th century,
in use in Lund from c.
1140. Mainly due to the Lundensian nature of the secondary text,
and the mentioning of St Canute,
St Olaf,
St Ansgar and St Rimbert in the Martyrology,
this manuscript has been considered a local product.
The peculiarities in the Martyrology,
with several names of bishops from Metz,
have been noted earlier,
but explained with an unreflected copying of a French prototype.
However,
the original disposition of the Martyrology has never allowed for neither the long nor the short vita of St Canute (f. 72r-v) and the emphasis given to St Godehard's name (f. 46v) might instead imply that the manuscript was executed in Reims or in Metz shortly after Godehard's canonisation in 1131.
It was taken into use in Lund some time between 1139 and 1146,
possibly in connection with the inauguration of the main altar in 1145,
as can be deduced from the dating of the secondary entries.

Arenkil died in 1698.
It is unknown where the book was between the beginning of the 15th century,
when it was no longer used,
and the 17th century when it came into the property of Arenkil.
It was seemingly not in the Cathedral when in 1578 Magnus Matthiae wrote his

An illuminated and historiated initial U,

in pink decorated with circles and crosses in white,
inscribed in a square with red frame and blue background embellished by small gilt roundels and thin white tracery.
The upper left serif extends into a leaf ornament in blue with gilt roundes,
the lower right serif into a small green leaf ornament.
The inner space of the initial is inhabited by three clercs in front of an altar.
The one to the left is dressed in blue with a belt in orange,
the one in the middle has a white alb and a blue dalmatic with silver lining,
the one to the right in with alb with gilt rubra and blue chausuble with silver lining.
To the right of him a blue altar with orange pediment and white mortar,
on which stands a veiled silver chalice.
The backgrond is mauve with minute white dots;

f. 122r :
A crude drawing in brown ink of a human face in profile;
.XP
f. 124v :
An illuminated and historiated initial D,
23 X 33 mm,
in blue with circles and dotted undy decoration in white and serifs ending in leaf ornaments in pink and orange.
The letter is inscribed in a square with light green frame and pink backround withgilt roundels and thin white tracery.
The inner space of the initial is inhabited by a bishop clad in white alb with gilt rubra,
chausuble in mauve with gilt lining and with white mitre and staff.
At his right side stands a crowned king with light green tunic and dark brown mantle,
and at his left stands a slender woman dressed in red.
These two reach their right hands to each other.
The background is blue with minute white dots.
.PP
Style:
The illuminated initials are minutely executed by the same accomplished artist,
working in the parisian tradition of e.g. the workshop of Johannes Grusch.
Although the small size and relative simplicity of the motifs makes a strong attribution difficult at this point,
Paris seems the most plausible place of origin.
The pen flourished initials are divided between three artists.
The slender and narrow pen flourished initials in the main portion of the manuscript (ff. 1r-195v) are executed around 1270 by artist A,
the last initial on f.
195v and the two on f.
196v ,
close in general appearance,
but less accomplished,
are executed by artist B,
while the remaining,
rounder and less detailed and close in style to the initials in Mh 10,
are executed by artist C towards the end of the century.
.PP
Iconography:
The scene with the three clerks on f.
70r depicts the consecration of the wine as a representative illustration of purely ecclesiastic matter as suggested by the text itself.
The betrothal on f.
124v illustrates the canonic view on marriage as a sacrament,
actively involving the blessing of the Church,
rather than an act of consensus between the two parties alone.

Decoration
.small
.PP
The decoration is restricted to initials,
with illuminated initials marking the beginning of each book,
except for book IV,
described below;
and numerous (approximately 150 two line initials in red or blue with comparatively modest pen flourishes in the complementary colour,
including perpendicularly chained rows of I-initials in alternating colours.

Detailed description
.small
.PP
f. 1r : Illuminated initial G,
in blue with white roundels,
inscribed in a gilt frame with light red background,
one serif protruding in upper margin.
The initial is inhabited by a small dragon,
the body of which is facing left,
with head turned backwards and tail curled in a spiral;
f. 69r :
Illuminated initial E in pink with deoration in white inscribed in a gilt frame against a blue background.
The filling is made up of symmetrically organized leaf ornaments in blue,
gold, pale green and small white dots against a red background;
f. 115r :
Illuminated initial F in pink with cross patterns in white and gold,
with a parallell staff in blue.
The lower half of the staff is constituted by a small blue dragon with white head biting the letter,
the tail of which ends,
together with the red background field,
in a curling leaf pattern with gilt roundels.
The filling of the initial is inhabited by two symmetrically arranged blue dragons with leaf decoration and gilt roundels against a red background;
f. 153 :
Illuminated initial P in ble with white decoration inscribed in a gilt frame against a pink background.
Staff ends with a small pink dragon biting the letter,
the tail of which ends in a curling leaf pattern with the small blue background strip.
The filling of the initial consists of two pink twigs,
rather than dragons,
but with a common head en face against a dark blue background.
.PP
Style:
The script and the illuminations are of a fairly common type,
but never the less of a high quality,
suggesting perhaps a Parisian origin,
showing the closest affinities with the works of Gautier Lebaube,
Johannes Grusch and the Soissons atelier.
A date not long after ca.
1250 seems most likely.

Decoration

.PP
A total of 26 pen flourished initials in red,
blue and towards the end also brown ink.
One initial decorated with a human face in profile.
Occasional line fillings and simple marginal decoration.
.PP
Three levels of initial decoration occur in the manuscript:
the lowest level is represented by the small monocoloured initials beginning the capitula of each code ("balk"). They are of the same heigth,
2-lines,
and type as the lombards of the running text,
with restrained or sometimes omitted pen flourishing (on ff.
1r, 29r, 78v, 82r, 93r, 109r,
118r, 122r,
126v, 129r). The main text of each code ("balk") begins with a large decorated 4-7-lines initial of the middle level,
in two or three colours with fillings of floral ornaments and surrounded by pen flourishes.
In the highest level,
represented by four initials,
the pen flourishes extend beyond the compartment of the letter,
forming horizontal and vertical borders.
In the case of the first large initial,
on f. 3r, the decoration has been further heigthened by a denser character and the adding of small birds.

Pomerania (?), late 14th century,
early 15th.
According to a note in the old catalogue it used to belong to a carthusian (?) convent in Szczecin/Stettin.
The front flyleaves is a reused notary document,
dated 1399 in Greifenhagen by Johannes Veddere (f. 2v) concerning the archdeacon of Landsberg who had been attacked by Franciscans and imprisoned in Stettin.
The back flyleaves are dated 1397 in Stargard (today Oldenburg) by Johannes Enghelkini (f. 257r ). The text is a protest written by Johannes Stoneveld,
prior of the Augustinian Hermits in Stargard against a decision that the brothers of his order no longer had confessional jurisdiction.

\fBScript:\fR Cursiva libraria by Johannes Johannis Kalmarnensis,
in Vadstena from 1404-1446 (cfr. f. 314v:
Conscriptus per manus fratris Johannis Johannis Kalmarnensis Orate pro eo.
). According to Wessén (1968, pp. 25-28, cfr. Bibliography), who does not think the script is that of an older man,
the manuscript was copied after 1404 when Johannes entered the convent (cfr. Diarium Vadstenense nr.
126, 151, 172:1, 254:2, 269, 273, 562) and before May 1415 when he left for Syon in England.

Cartouches in red or green surrounding 21 of the catch words,
small red crosses in the margins and numerous pointing hands and related readers' additions.
Most of the two coloured initials were intended to be green,
but due to the oxidization the green pigment was scraped off and replaced by red minium.
The green pigment was replaced by blue in the latter part of the manuscript.

A later cursive hand,
most likely from the first half of the 16th century,
has written f.

Decoration
.small
.PP
The original decoration consists of a total of 17 illuminated initials of two sizes:
smaller 3-5-lines initials on ff.
1r , 24r ,
38r , 48v ,
58r , 65r ,
98r , and larger 7-9-lines initials on ff.
131r ,
144v ,
156r ,
181v ,
195r ,
210r ,
220r ,
233v ,
249v ;
one 16-lines initial (I) on f.
113r .
They are all painted by one artist with brush in blue,
pink, yellow,
green and different red tones from light pink to mauve and unblended bright red,
with fine details in white and brown ink;
preliminary drawings in pencil are visible in several instances e.g. on ff.
65r and 220r .
One intended initial on f.
130v was never carried out,
and the smallest initials in the beginning of the manuscript are simple lombards.
.PP
The larger initials are all in the commentary to the Aeneid although the first two initials in this text (ff. 65r and 98r) are small.
The marked ending of the commentary to the Georgics suggests a clear division of the book in two halves,
but the fact that the increase in decorative effect was not introduced until f.
113r ,
points towards a probable slight altering of plans during work.
.PP
In all 17 initials the body of the letter is pink,
the internal background yellow,
the surrounding frame blue and the leaf ornaments green,
reddish and blue.
Heightenings with thin white lines in ornamental figures are distributed over the whole surface of the initial,
but generally more detailed on the body of the letter.
Secondary decoration include maniculae on ff.
7r , 155r ,
174r and cartouches around marginal scholia in the shape of a balloon like object on f.
147v ,
a bowl on f.
178v ,
and a scroll on f.
191r .
.PP
Style:
During the 14th and early 15th Century Ragusa (Dubrovnik) lay under Venice and later under Hungary.
In comparison with Bohemian and Dalmatian manuscripts,
the style of this manuscript is undoubtedly not coherent with a more germanic aspect,
but shows obvious Italian features.
An Italian import,
probably from Milan or surrounding Lombardy is likely,
also considering the lombard water-marks.
The characteristics of the style is fully developped in northern Italian manuscripts from the late 14th century,
with close relatives in Milan around 1400,
suggesting that the note of 1455 can not be taken as the date of production,
which cautiously is set to the first half of the 15th century.

Style:
Both figure style and the disposition of elements in the decorative borders are coherent with high quality Venetian and Ferrarese illumination from the middle of the 15th century,
but with certain reactionary features as the gothic leaf-sprays pointing to an early face in the development.
The smaller pen flourished initials show a controlled artificial version of renaissance lettering with rows of circular ornaments inside the body of the letter clinging to the parallell strokes continuing into the flourishes.
The semilarge and large initials with their panelled decoration can be compared to display script from many north Italian centres of high quality.
The foliate borders are closely reminescent of Ferrarese work but are more sparsely constructed and less confined to a disciplined border-appearance than the Ferrarese counterparts,
although close relatives are found in the early works of Giorgio d'Allemagna and Guglielmo Giraldi such as the Virgil made in 1458 for the venetian ambassador to Ferrara,
Leonardo Sanudo (Paris,
BN, Ms. 7939 A), and the somewhat earlier manuscript of "La Spagna in rima", (Ferrara,
Bibl. Communale Ariostea,
Ms. II 132), illuminated by Giorgio d'Allemagna for Borso d'Este. The Ferrarese elements cannot be denied,
but must be regarded as important influences on an early phase of the Venetian book illumination rather than a Ferrarese origin.
The composition of the illuminated initials with a segmented and dotted border along the red edge on f.
51r , and on the green curling leaves,
imitative of pearl-rows, the twist of the leaf around the top horisontal,
the loosely tied flag-end of the horisontal on f.
51r , the use of ornamentation and colours,
the disposition of flowers in oblique angles within the foliage of the frame which is rythmically ondulating rather than covering,
together with a round-faced,
red-cheeked and rather serene figure-style,
all occur in the same combination in the work of Leonardo Bellini,
to whom the illuminations of Medeltidshandskrift 27 now are attributed.
(For Leonardo Bellini see:
G. Mariani Canova,
La Miniatura Veneta del Rinascimento 1450 - 1500,
Venezia 1969,
pp. 22-24, 103-104, 142-144; Ulrike Bauer-Eberhardt,
"Die Rothschild-Miscellanea in Jerusalem,
Hauptwerk des Leonardo Bellini", Pantheon XLII/III, München 1984,
pp. 229-237). The shape of the coat of arms is repeated in the Lactantius Ms., the posture,
with exaggerated contraposto,
and the armour of Aeneas is closely related to the figure of the archangel Michael in the Oxford breviary,
Oxford,
Bodl. Libr., Ms. Canon.
Liturg.
371, f. 7r. The general appearance of the figures,
folds and faces can be found througholut The Rothschild Miscellany (Jerusalem,
Israel Museum,
Ms. 180/51) from c.
1470. The foliated borders with flowers depicted in oblique angles in a sparse,
ondulating flow,
can be seen above all in the two manuscripts mentioned and the Copia della Promissione di Antonio Venier (Venezia,
Bibl. Marciana,
Ms. Lat. X, 190) from c.
1458, whereas in his later works the ornamental borders tend to stiffen and get more crowded.
Medeltidshandskrift 27 is here considerred to be contemporary with the Bible,
Venezia,
Bibl. Marciana,
Ms. Lat. I, 16, dated by the scribe 1457,
the Lactantius manuscript,
Venezia,
Bibl. Marciana,
Ms. Lat. II, 75, also dated by the scribe to 1457,
Oxford,
Bodl. Libr., Ms. Canon.
Liturg.
371, which Ulrike Bauer-Eberhardt ascribed to Leonardo Bellini's own hand and dated it close to the Lactantius Ms.
(c. 1457). Close affinities are also found on a separate leaf from a Venetian confraternity in the collection of a Paris dealer,
dated in the text to 1443.
There is reason to beleive that the date is referring to the scuola itself rather than to the manuscript,
which is more likely to be dated around 1455-60.
.PP
Iconography:
The seated figure playing the bagpipe in the historiated initial (T) on f.
1r is identified by the illustrated text itself "Tityre,
tu patulae recubans\&..." and later "et ipsum ludere quae vellem calamo permisit agresti." as the shepherd Tityrus,
the alter ego of Virgil and a self evident motif in this context.
The choice of musical instrument has been subject to some variation in the virgilian iconography.
Tityrus playing the bagpipe occurs otherwise e.g. in the Omnia opera,
printed by Bartlomeo de'Zanni in Venice 1510,
and in the ms.
Reg. Lat. 1988 (f. 1r) of the Vatican Library,
probably illuminated in Rome c.
1456-58 and can be seen as a more rustic approach to the text.
The figure in the initial (Q) on f.
14r depicts the anonymous peasant tending to his soil described in the first book of Georgics "who grazes down his luxuriant crop in the young blade,
soon as the growing corn is even with the furrow's top." The armed soldier in the initial A on f.
51r illustrates the opening line of the Aeneid "Arma virumque" depicting Aeneas standing in solitude,
freed from the narrative.

Origin
.small
.PP
Northern Italy,
1460-1480. The manuscript was produced for a member of the Barbarigo family in Venice as shown by the worn coat of arms on f.
1r. Several other mss.
belonging to other members of the same family are known:
Wien, Bibl.
nat. 39 of 1456,
also Virgil,
made for Girolamo Barbarigo;
two mss.
from the Royal Library in Copenhagen described by Ellen Joergensen in Catalogus codicum latinorum medii aevi Bibliothecae Regiae Hafniensis,
Hafniae 1926,
p. 296 (Koebenhavn,
KB, Ny kgl.
S. 214:b 4to) and p.
385 (Koebenhavn,
KB, Gl. kgl. S. 1928 4to) with reproductions of the coats of arms (pl. VI. 5). There is at present no way of telling which member of the influential ducal family was the owner of Medeltidshandskrift 27.
Chronologically both doges Marco d.
1486 and Agostino d.
1501 are possible candidates,
as is Daniele Barbarigo,
the owner of other manuscripts in Copenhagen and Vienna,
Wien, UB, Cod. Ser. n. 26030 (olim I 528397 [Ms I 978]), dated 1463,
and Girolamo Barbarigo d.
1501, who was elected Capo del Consiglio dei Dieci in 1455.
One could suspect connections between the Barbarigo family and the humanists Guarino da Verona and Leonardo Sanudo or his relative Lorenzo Sanudo,
who comissioned both Guglielmo Giraldi,
Giorgio d'Alemagna and Leonardo Bellini to illuminate manuscripts,
including the Lactantius Ms.
and the Virgil Ms.
Paris,
BN, Ms. 7939 A,
thus indicating Lorenzo Sanudo as a probable source of acquisition.

Detailed description
.small
.PP
f. 1r : Blue initial I with floral white void decoration flanked by pen flourished pearl bordure in red heightened with green,
and accompanied by pen flourishes extending vertically along left margin,
and horizontally in organically ondulating lines in lower margin heightened with green;
f. 63v :
Blue initial E with simple white void decoration,
filled with filigranated leaf pattern and flanked by extensive ondulating pen flourishes in red along left margin.
.PP
Style:
All initials are apparently executed by the same artist,
presumably identical with the scribe Arnold from Leiden,
active in Leydendorp.
Features characteristic of Dutch pen flourishes as the delicately ondulating lines with interspersed hooks and small circles are very close in style to the products from Delft (e.g. Medeltidshandskrift 32a) not far south of Leiden.
In Medeltidshandskrift 29 the decoration is less fluent and distinct however,
although executed by an accomplished artist.

Binding

Panel-stamped brown calfskin binding.
Netherlands,
likely Leyderdorp,
contemporary with the manuscript.
Rebacking,
Germany,
signed in pencil on the inside of the lower cover:
Restauriert Stefan Heiland 1963 .
Size: 148 x 118 x 55 mm.
.PP
Brown calfskin binding over rounded wooden boards,
rebacked with former back covering preserved.
Joints with some cracking.
Two metal hook-clasp fastenings at fore-edge, straps and hooks missing.
Rounded and backed spine.
Tight back with four raised bands.
Saddle-stitched endbands,
resewn with the new back.
Trimmed edges,
no squares.
One flyleaf and pastedown at the front and three flyleaves and pastedown of parchment at the back.
Back pastedown mounted on former pastedown.
On f. i verso several former library shelf marks:
Bibl. Ms. H. L. a) 4o 3 and another,
erased and illegible note.
It might have carried the same text as the cancelled note,
in a later hand (Gustaf Sommelius,
d. 1799,
librarian?) , below:
Arnoldi Fratris Philosophi Leidensis Exegesis Evangeliorum ,
a note that might explain Kernkamp's mistaken reading of the colophon (explicatio psalmorum fratris instead of explicit per manus fratris ). There is also a note with the Meck callnumber:
Mscr: é Biblioth.
Meckiana No XXIII.
The back pastedown contains two modern shelf marks (29), one of which is a piece of paper glued to the lower part of the pastedown;
the other is on artificial leather,
in the form of a bookmark,
glued to the inner corner of the pastedown so as to be visible even when the book is closed.
Inner joints restored with Japanese paper.
All along sewing on three raised cords laced through the boards.
.PP
The covers are blind-tooled with a triple fillet frame and a row of rosettes in two alternating sizes enclosing a panel stamped in blind.
The panel (80 x 50 mm.) depicts Maria as Regina Humilitatis sitting on the ground with her child.
The inscription of the panel border reads:
ihesus | maria | o mater dei | memento mei .

Detailed description
.small
.PP
f. 13r (parchment): full page border by Artist A with elegantly twisting,
symmetrically arranged leaf and flower decoration in alternating blue and red pen drawing with gilt dots;
an intarsiated 9-line initial (S), with filigranated filling in red (upper field) and blue (lower field) with flowers in contrasting colours with gilt centres.
Along the right side of the textblock,
inside the marginal decoration,
a stem in brownish red with leaf-endings in red,
green and yellow extend vertically into the decorated area.
In the right margin,
covering roughly the second top quarter of the decorated area,
an illuminated half-length figure representing the prophet Zachariah appearing from a tripartite gilt cloud,
holding a scroll inscribed with the dutch translation of Zach.
14:5, and dressed in a blue cloak heightened with gilt strokes and a bright red soft hat with big flaps in ochre suggesting fur.
.PP
Style:
Initials by artist A are highly detailed with dense patterns and organically fluent pen flourishes in thin distinctly drawn lines.
.PP
Artist B uses a third colour (mauve,
green), intarsiated letters in blue and red with fillings of leaf-ornaments rather than filigranation and stiff pen flourishes dominated by repeated curls.
.PP
Artist C uses diverging straight or slightly curving lines interspersed with numerous dots.
.PP
Artist D,
like artist B,
uses leaf-ornaments instead of filigranation in the letter-fillings,
intarsiated letter-forms and occasionally a third colour,
though never green.
The pen flourishes of artist D often show distinctly naturalistic features,
less stylized than those of artist A,
but executed with the same skill.
Triangular fields of parallel thin strokes beside the letters are characteristic.
.PP
All the decoration in Medeltidshandskrift 32a,
especially that of artists A and D clearly belong to the "Delft block group" usually ascribed to the convent of St Agnes in Delft.
The style of artist B show a tendency towards the "Delft scallop group", whereas the rather coarse style of artist C is more genrally Dutch in character.
.PP
Artist A is identical to the main artist in Den Haag,
KB, 128 D 28 (ff. 1r , 44r ,
73r , 121r) made for the Tertiaries of the Convent of St Ursula in Delft 1476;
in Den Haag,
KB, 133 E 19 (the decorated initial pages) dated to 1460-80; in Den Haag,
KB, 135 E 22 (with a Utrecht calendar), and in Den Haag KB,
135 F2,
Leiden,
UB, LTK, 288 (the frame on f.
221r ); possibly in Huntington Library HM 1127 (Dutschke 1989) and in Cleveland Museum,
The Jeanne Blackburn Collection 1999.133 (Stephen N.
Fliegel,
The Jeanne Miles Blackburn Collection of Manuscript Illuminations,
1999).
.PP
Artist B is possibly identical to the artist of Leiden,
UB, Ltk, 262, and similar,
but not identical,
to the main artist in Den Haag,
KB, 78 J 47 (dated 1440-60) and Den Haag KB,
135 F2,
suggesting perhaps a somewhat older artist than A.
.PP
Artist C is less accomplished and close to one of the artists in Leiden,
UB, Voss.
Germ. Gall.
Fol. 7, (e.g. f. 5r), dated to 1459.
.PP
Artist D is more flamboyant than artist A,
and show similarities with manuscripts from Schoonhoven such as Leiden UB Ltk 244,
although these features do fit into a Delft context.
.PP
The blend of the more modern artists A and D,
active around 1460 - 80, and the sligthly older features of artist B and C,
probably active mainly around 1440 - 60, suggests a date for Medeltidshandskrift 32a around 1460 - 70, during which the two tendencies overlap,
although a sligthly later date cannot be excluded.
.PP
Considering the fact that the space left to be filled by a similar half-length figure in Leiden,
UB, Ltk. 288, f. 176r,
and the fact that the half-length figure on f.
13r in Den Haag,
KB, 135 F2 is executed by the same artist active in Medeltidshandskrift 32a (whereas the decorative border is not) the half-length figure on f.
13r in Medeltidshandskrift 32a is not necessarily executed by artist A,
but could be attributed to a separate artist.
However,
since artist A is identified in the border on f.
221r in Den Haag,
KB, 135 F2,
and the caracteristic style of the half-length figures otherwise occurs in numerous manuscripts in immediate connection to borders decorated by artist A,
the half-length figures must be attributed to artist A.
This artist is not likely to be identical with the anonymous Master of the Delft Half-length Figures,
although a close relationship between the two is obvious.
.PP
Iconography:
The half length figure in the margin on f.
13r is identified as the prophet Zachariah through the quotation.
The prophet's dress with its original hat is to be understood as an orientalizing feature,
often associated with persons of the Old Testament.

Binding
.small
.PP
Blind-tooled brown calfskin binding,
preserved decorated covering Netherlands contemporary with the manuscript.
Rebinding most likely Sweden 20th century.
Size: 200 x 150 x 65 mm.
.PP
Brown calfskin binding over rounded wooden boards.
Rebinding with leather covering of former binding preserved on the new covers.
Two preserved metal hook-clasp fastenings at fore-edge, straps and nails new.
Rounded spine.
Tight back with five raised bands.
Blind-tooled library cloth label at the tail of the back.
Embroidered endbands of white linen.
Trimmed edges.
Front flyleaf of parchment and back flyleaf of paper,
both mounted on guards,
separate parchment pastedowns.
Front flyleaf and pastedowns from former binding.
On front paste down a white label with the present shelf mark and the former call number (cfr. above). Below the Meck number a faded note on the contents of the ms.: på Hålländska and below another former callnumber:
Bibl. Ms. Th. 4:o 1 .All along sewing on five double cords laced through the boards.
Textblock with paper restorations.
.PP
The covers are blind-tooled to a triple fillet panel with corners.
The frame of the panel is decorated with a repeated rosette,
leaf, star and lily.
The panel is divided into lozenge-shaped triple fillets compartments and the central compartment is stamped with a repeated rosette.

The manuscript was written in the end of the 15th century,
either in Lund or in Trondheim for the use of Lund (cfr. the feast of St.
Euphrosyna and Florentina,
whose relics were kept in the cathedral in Lund,
at f. 383v ,
and parchment bookmarks that indicate for instance the feast of St.
Laurence on f.
401v ). A note on the upper pastedown (contemporary with the manuscript) says:
Reverendissumus In christo pater Dominus Ericus Workendorp Archiepiscopus Nidrosienssis et apostalice sedis legatus,
quondam huius Ecclesie prepositus dignissimus,
Hunc librum suis impensis scriptum dedit ad usum pauperum sacerdotum huius Ecclesie.
Anno Domino,
1522 .

Decoration
.small
.PP
The original decoration in red ink pen drawing is confined to 28 initials divided in three hierarchical levels or groups.
The decoration is varied only in quantity and everything is undoubtedly executed after the main text and by the scribe himself.
.PP
Style:
The decorative effect is emphasized by the frequent use of void details in the body of the letter and the grid-like disposition of the geometrical or filigranated patterns in the fillings.
The decoration is repeated in Ms.

Stockholm ,
and Ms.

Blind-tooled brown leather binding,

contemporary with the manuscript.
Rebinding Germany,
Stuttgart,
signed by Hans Heiland,
1964. Size:
220 x 150 x 33 mm.
.PP
Brown leather binding over thick and rounded wooden boards.
Rebinding with upper cover from former binding preserved,
lower cover and spine have new leather covering.
One metal hook-clasp fastening (strap and nails new). Rounded spine.
Tight back with four raised double bands.
Brown library cloth label at the tail of the back.
Former edge trimming preserved.
Single flyleaves of parchment,
frontleaf new.
Former endleaves of parchment preserved as separate pastedowns.
On the front pastedown a note on the contents of the manuscript and a former callnumber (cfr. above). On the back pastedown crossed out notes in the hand of Vincent Lunge,
according to the editor of the text a list of jewellery left to Vincent Lunge as a pledge.
All along sewing on four raised cords laced through the boards.
Textblock with restored folds.
One page with photographic documentation of former binding and description of the rebinding preserved on the pastedown of the lower cover.
In the rebinding process the binder must have shifted the covers which were upside down before the restoration (cfr. photographs and description by Huitfeldt-Kaas, p. 470). The scribe thus must have started to write (as noted also by Huitfeldt-Kaas) in the wrong end of the book.
.PP
The covers are blind-tooled with a double line fillet into nine rectangular compartments.
The corner compartments are tooled into lozenges,
the others with large rosettes.
The central compartment is stamped with a panel (77 x 51 mm) depicting the Madonna and her child in an architectural renaissance setting.

The manuscript was inherited by the daughter of Vincents Lunge,
Blanceflor and her husband Daniel Bildt of Morlanda Herrgård where it remained until it came into the possession of Sven Lagerbring (1707-1787), professor of history at the university of Lund.
It came to the library either with the rest of his manuscripts or later,
in ab.

Illuminated gilt initials on f.
72v : very small fragment (up-side-down) of illuminated initial in red and blue;
f. 112v - 113r:
large fragment of a large illuminated and gilt historiated initial.
Against the blue background of the stem of the letter,
a man dressed in mauve tunic and a red cloak with his right hand raised across the upper part of his torso is standing on a crouching dragon in pink,
yellow,
orange and white,
the tail of which is extended below the dragon to the left and ending in a swirl of leaves with a standing bird in blue and orange.
On the outside of the dragon is a framing field of burnished gold on raised gesso ground;
f. 122r :
fragment (up-side-down) of illuminated initial.
The lower part of a stem in blue and pink and the tail shaped like a swirl of leaves in blue,
orange,
yellow and green with details of burnished gold on raised gesso ground;
f. 171v :
small fragment of illuminated initial with tail shaped like a swirl of leaves in blue,
orange,
yellow with details of burnished gold on raised gesso ground;
f. 189r :
fragment (up-side-down) of inhabited illuminated initial.
The lower part of a stem in pink and the tail shaped like a swirl of leaves in blue,
orange,
yellow and green with details of burnished gold on raised gesso ground.
Standing on top of the leaves,
facing the stem of the letter,
is a small dragon in orange,
white and green;
f. 208r :
small fragment (up-side-down) of illuminated initial with tail shaped like a swirl of leaves in pink,
blue, yellow and green with details of burnished gold on raised gesso ground;
f. 269r :
small fragment (up-side-down) with tail shaped like a swirl of leaves in blue,
ink and orange;
ff. 269v - 270r:
fragment (up-side-down) of illuminated initial with tail shaped like a swirl of leaves in blue,
pink, orange,
yellow and green with details of burnished gold on raised gesso ground.
.PP
Style:
The remaining portion of the primary decoration clearly shows the work of a French workshop of high quality from the third quarter of the 13th century,
most probably Parisian and closely related to the Vie de Saint Denis atelier (cfr. Branner,
fig. 253). There is however not enough remaining elements to establish a definitive attribution without extensive comparisons.
.PP
Iconography:
The image of a man standing on the back of a subdued dragon (f. 112v - 113r) is certainly depicting either a prophet,
an evangelist (St. John) or Christ Logos.
Given that the stems of the other illuminated initials are much thinner,
it is likely to be an initial I,
allowing for the stem to be historiated.
Since the figure is not holding a book (unless it is not given to him from above) and the figure raises his right arm in front of the body this may imply a blessing gesture in accordance with the scenes of the six days of Creation,
Genesis 1:1, found in most French 13th century bible mss.
In this case both the extraordinary length of the initial and the presence of a bird would be accounted for.
On the other hand,
the beginning of the Gospel according to St.
John "In principio erat verbum" is as suitable.

Detailed description

.PP
f. 8r : Illuminated historiated initial E in blue with oxydized floral decoration in silver on the body of the letter,
inscribed in a gilt square compartment with a frame in black ink.
The centre of the initial is occupied by a monochrome gilt representation of a standing figure in a mantle and a topped hat,
facing right and holding a scroll between two perpendicular bars against a pinkish purple background with darker tones for shadows.
The floriated border covers the entire left margin and half the upper and lower margins,
leaving the right text column unaccentuated.
The border is filled with acantus leaves in blue and gold,
violets in violet,
pink and blue,
flower buds in gold,
leaves in light green and small spermazoid space fillers in black ink.
The border is framed by at thin red line complemented by a gilt line to the right.
.PP
Style:
The characteristic technique with minute strokes in gilt against a monochrome background is totally coherent with the high quality illuminations of Tours from the second half of the 15th century associated with the workshop of

dated to c.
1450 (Gyllene böcker,

Stockholm 1987,
Cat. Nr. 60 Stockholm,

.PP
Iconography:
The identity of the standing figure on f.
8r as a prophet is suggested by the scroll and the oriental hat.

7-8 mm thick,
of concentric bands in red,
orange and pink between white and red contours,
and knobbed sprouts in the corners.
Background divided in three compartments,
dark blue sky,
city wall in pink and bright green grass,
badly flaked.
The figure of St Matthew centrally placed against an architectural setting,
is seated facing right and holding a scroll with both hands on a low cushioned bench with crossed feet resting on a suppedaneum.
To the right a desk with two ink-pots and an opened gospel book on a tall pulpit.
The towered building to the left in ochre is placed obliquely in the picture space,
with a tall narrow rounded opening and slavic ornamentation.
On top of the lower protruding roof is an attic with three rounded openings in front and a triangular gable field,
covered by a saddle roof.
The left facade is pierced by a rectangular opening and decorated with several registers of sculptural details in white with rows of affronted triangles.
The opposite tower in light turqoise,
also placed obliquely facing the centre of the picture,
has a rectangular narrow opening,
and the right facade pierced by a rectangular opening and with the same sculptural decoration.
The roof is designed as a wide cornice crowned by a domed superstructure,
the columns of which are illogically standing on the outer side of the cornice.
Between the towers,
a cyrillic titulus in white ink.
The figure of the evangelist is dressed in a light blue tunic with soft folds in darker blue and highlights in white,
a mantle in ochre with colour gradation from dark mauve to bright pink,
fluent contours in brown and sharp highlights in white,
black sandals and a dark blue halo with lighter contour.
Skin hue is dark mauve to pink with relatively dark highlights,
dark eyes,
hair and beard grey with blue strokes.
Bench,
suppedaneum and desk in ochre with red contours and star shaped highlights,
sturdy legs and perspectivic distortions.

red, orange and pink bands and a white inner contour.
From each corner a leaf ornament in orange,
blue and green with white details.
Dark greyish blue background.
The tower to the left rendered frontally in light green with accentuated details,
a tall narrow opening,
a lower roof in red and a polygonal superstructure with three square openings and a pointed roof in blue with details in white.
The tower to the right in reddish brown,
accentuated with sculptural details,
is placed diagonally with a tall and narrow rectangular opening flanked by two slim columns with protruding corbels,
a flat blue roof with details in white.
The wall between the towers is pink with darker shades and highlights in white,
decorated with sculptural zig-zag ornaments and flowers.

and a yellow band across the shoulder,
and a mantle changing from dark and reddish brown to greenish and pinkish grey.
The skin hue is dark ochre with nuances of red and green with a few white highlights,
hair and beard brown,
eyes black and halogreyish blue with lighter contour.
To the left,
standing behind the evangelist,
is a winged figure in light red tunic,
yellow superhumeral and blue mantle.
The one visible wing is pinkish grey with darker wing-tips. The skin-hue and hair is the same as on the evangelist,
but without the beard.
The halo consists of two obliquely superimposed squares,
a red over a blue with white contours,
and a white ribbon is tied around the hear.
The upper surface of the pulpit and the suppedaneum,
as well as the feet of the evangelist have flaked badly.
.PP

.PP
f. 242v :
Illuminated full page portrait of St John accompanied by his scribe Prokoros seated outisde a cave in the desert.
Painted space 157 x 95 mm.
The frame,
8-9 mm thick,
consists of dark red outer contour,
red, orange and pink bands and a white inner contour.
Orange knobs protrude from the corners.
The narrow irregular strip of heaven is dark greyish blue,
lighter hue immediately above the mountain tops.
In the left corner a segment with contour in white with a smaller orb flying down toward the figure of St John,
signifying the divine inspiration,
personified by a small white dove or angel.
The mountains and rocky surroundings are rendered in ochre with shades in red and white highlights.
Cyrillic tituli in black.
The opening to the cave is all black.
The person symmetrically placed with St John seated on a light ochre bench with his feet resting on a foot stool is dressed in a red mantle with highlights in blue and white,
and a green cloak heightened with red.
The evangelist is rendered as an old slightly bald man with grey hair and beard,
and a blue nimbus.
His body is facing the centre of the picture with his right hand resting on his knee and his left hand raised towards Prokoros as in attendance while he turns his head to the left receiving the divine inspiration.
The younger beardless equally nimbed Prokoros is seated on a brown cushion directly on the rock with his left foot on St John's foot stool.
His tunic is blue with narrow lining in yellow,
and his mantle is red with highlights in ochre and white.
In his left hand he holds a scroll across his knee with the first words of the Gospel written in black ink.
In his right hand he holds a pen and in front of him,
between the two figures,
are an ink pot and a pen stand in grey against the black of the cave opening.
.PP
f. 243r :
A large head piece 70 x 115 mm consisting of red vines intricately intersecting in circular and square formations with voids coloured dark blue or ochre with white crosses.
In the corners and on top symmetrical leaf decorations in red with occasional blue details.
Initial in blue,
green and red vines intertwined.
.PP
f. 309r :
A large head piece 53 x 83 mm.
The central motif is a yellow stemmed vine with leaves in red,
green and blue against a background in black with delicate details in white.
The panel is surrounded by a frame in orange with ondulating leaf decoration in black.
Flowers and leaves in red,
blue, green and ochre in the corners and on top.
.PP
Technique:
Preliminary drawings in lead to portraits,
head pieces and initials are visible where the colour has flaked off,
or the decoration was never finished.
They show numerous deviations from the finished versions.
The manuscript is undoubtedly executed during the middle of the 16th century,
which is coherent with both the water-marks (similar to Briquet 12791 and 11025), and the general style of the Novgorod school of icon-painting.
.PP
Iconography:
The inspiring personification in the portrait of St Mark on f.
93v is identified as the holy Wisdom,
Angel-Premydrosti,
or Sophia,
Sapientia.
Although often depicted without wings,
the double rombic halo and the position behind the evangelist whispering the divine word is typical for the character.
A common version includes the figure of Wisdom pointing at the text written by the evangelist.
In Medeltidshandskrift 39 the scene is calm and meditative since the Evangelist is pausing from his writing in order to sharpen his pen.

.PP
Besides chapter divisions,
the text of the four Gospels is divided into subdivisions,
so-called začalos.
The Gospel of St.
Matthew consists of 116 začalos,
St. Mark has 71 za?alos, St. Luke - 114, St. John - 67. They are marked in red ink in the margin of the text (on f. 154r.
blue ink), together with chapter markings in black ink.
There are also marginal notes written in red ink by the same hand as the rest of the text in the upper and lower margin with instructions on when a specific začalo should be read (the note on f.
243r is written in blue ink). The corresponding lections are rubricated in the text with explicit.
On ff.
71r, 137r,
219r, 219v,
226r, 295v there are additional indications of the Passion lections in the text.
These are written in black ink of a different kind and by a different hand then the rest of the text.
Ff. 9r, 10r, 94r and 316v contain additional marginalia in a later hand and ink different from the text,
probably concerning the use of the book.

Foliation
.small
.PP
The manuscript has two foliations,
both in upper right corner of pages:
one foliation in Russian numerals in ink,
most likely done by Ivan Něčaev (the same ink and the same probationes pennae as on front pastedown). The Russian foliation runs:
i + (1)(1) - 7, 24 - 202, 204, 203, 205 - 209, 211, 213 - 482, 482 - 488 + i; ff. 8-23 (= quires 2 and 3) are missing;
conjugate leaves 203 and 204 are rearranged probably in connection with the re-binding.
The modern foliation in pencil was probably applied by the binder in connection with the rebinding.
It is continuous and does not take the Russian foliation in consideration.
The first text carrying leaf is f.
6 presumably because the front pastedown and the flyleaves (today ff.
i and ii) were once paginated 1-5. This foliation runs:
i-ii + 6-474 (+ ff. 56b; 191b) + iii.

Acquisition
.small
.PP
  Medeltidshandskrift 40 was donated to Lund university library in 1722 (present and former call numbers on front pastedown) by Carl Schultén (1677-1730), professor of theology, together with another Russian manuscript (Medeltidshandskrift 39), a gospel book from the 16th century. There was a colonel Ivan Konstantinovich Nechaev (d. 1719) who could have been the owner of Medeltidshandskrift 40. He was an officer in the Russian army and he may well have fought against the Swedes in Estonia in the early 18th century. Schultén worked at the university of Pärnu in 1704-1709. Thus the assumption that Schultén could have come across the book during his stay in Estonia is not improbable.

History
./smallcaps
.small
.big

.ft I
Origin
.small
.PP
The manuscript was written by the priest/scribe Petrus Jacobi (Per Ibsen?) according to a crossed out note in red ink on f.
1r: Petrus Iacobi possidet hunc librum presbiter licet indignus .
Between 1513 and 1522 the printed and the handwritten part were bound together in the same volume.
When Peter Wieselgren described the book in 1830 (cfr. Lunds Universitetsbiblioteks Arkiv A IV b 10) it was still like that.
It was subsequently taken apart and when Strömberg talks about the manuscript part "was kept loose in a parchment cover". Strömberg proved that it had once been bound with the printed manual and since then it has again,
probably as a result of Strömberg's analysis,
been rebound with it.
.big
.SH
.ft I
Provenance
.small
.PP
There are five notes of ownership and they thus pertain to both printed and handwritten part.
In 1522 the book was owned by the church St.
Mary Magdalene in Bystorp in the diocese of Roskilde,
cfr. the crossed out notes on the upper pastedown:
Liber ecclesie sancte marie magdalene de bystorp and on the title page of the printed manual:
Liber ecclesie Bystorp ;
see also the note above the colophon of the printed text:
Liber ecclesie bystorp mdxxii .
The same hand has crossed out the ex libris of Petrus Iacobi and added a fourth note,
also crossed out:
Liber ecclesie bystorp Mdxxii .
According to Strömberg the crossed out note on the recto of f.
ii, today illegible,
says: ecclesia sancti sanguinis [apella]tur and in fact Bystorp was a much visited pilgrimage church.
It was pulled down in the second half of the 16th century.

Acquisition
.small
.PP
By the end of the 17th century the book was owned by E.
J. Meck (1644-1702). In 1704 the manuscript arrived in the University Library as part of a donation of 25 manuscripts out of which 7 Medieval (see Gerle E.

Origin

  The watermarks, all coherent with a date around 1500-1510, corroborates the dating by the note 1505 on f.  47v , 1506 on f.  71v and  72r , and the birth of someone in 1477 indicated by the horoscope on f.  26r . The note on f.  64v in German Tauel dex Sunnen hoch im mittag auff eyn yeder grad dex 12 zaithen auff Nurnberg do dex polus ist 49 grad 30 mto together with a note on f.  49v which specifies that the tables are adapted for a latidudinal position of 48 degrees, suggests that the manuscript was executed in e.g. Munich or Vienna and later transferred to Nuremberg.

Style:
The diagrams,
probably executed by the scribe Paulus zighanus in 1444,
do not produce any significant stylistic features leading to the geographical origin of the manuscript.
The decorated initial on f.
60v , however,
shows typically Italian leaf forms.
The secondary note on f.
88v , which indicates a provenance at some date at Genova,
together with the watermark,
suggests a north Italian origin.

Reversed whittawed leather binding,
contemporary with the manuscript.
Size: 315 x 230 x 45 mm.

  Reversed whittawed leather binding over rounded beech boards. The covering is worn, partly torn and missing at the spine. A piece of parchment manuscript waste with seven initials in alternating red or blue with restricted pen flourishes in opposite colour has been used for later repair of the back. The parchment is torn, defect and does not hold to the spine. Traces of two lost metal fastenings at fore-edge. Trimmed edges. Pastedowns of parchment, detached from boards. The joints are repaired by large hinges of parchment strips. Endbands missing. All along packed sewing on four double leather thongs laced through the boards. All sewing supports are cracked in the joints except one of the lower board.

That the text is written in Vadstena is clear not only from the script but also from the quotations from Birgitta.
In the margins there are notes,
mainly concerning the De la Gardie provenance (ff. 2r and 4r:

.PP
Style:
Although liturgically adopted for the use of Utrecht,
the manuscript show no characteristics of the Utrecht style,
but closer affinities with flemish products,
above all from Bruges.
Compare with Den Haag,
KB 76 F 30 made by the Master of the Small Eyes c.
1440 - 60 or with Den Haag,
MMW 10 F13 from 1479 and Den Haag,
KB, 135 G10,
made c 1460 for the Use of Utrecht by a follower of Willem Vrelant,
born in Utrecht,
but active in Bruges.
.PP
The historiated initials are generally of a higher quality than the full-page miniatures,
and closeley related to the workshop of Willem Vrelant,
though not to the master himself.
Numerous features,
such as the treatment of folds,
floor decoration,
landscape and architecture are identical in the miniatures and the initials,
suggesting that the whole extant illuminated decoration,
with the exception of the frames and borders,
is the work of one artist,
who probably was more accustomed to working in the small format.
.PP
Iconography:
In the Anna selbdritt the feature of the gilt object in the hand of the Virgin is tentatively interpreted as an egg.
An egg also occurs in the picture of the standing Madonna in St.
Louis,
Washington University Library,
Ms 3, where the motif is juxtaposed with a peacock.
In Medeltidshandskrift 52,
the peacock has moved from the actual image to the foliated frame of the facing page.
Since the St Louis manuscript has been attributed to the circle around Willem Vrelant as well,
the iconographical connection between the two manuscripts corroborate the supposition of a common origin.
The motif prefigures the Passion and Resurrection of Christ.
.PP
The deposition includes Nicodemus,
Joseph of Arimathea,
St. Mary and St.
John.
.PP
The composition of the Last Judgement with Christ seated on a rainbow flanked by two trumpet-blowing angels,
his right hand raised in blessing,
his left lowered in rejection,
and the resurrection of the dead between St.
Mary and St.
John, is repeated in numerous Books of Hours,
and is fully consistent with the Bruges tradition (cfr. the above mentioned St Louis,
Washington UL,
Ms 3). The Judgement is allegorically commented by the struggling men in the lower margin.
.PP
The miracle of manna shows consecrated wafers with images of the Crucifixion,
allegorically linking the scene of Exodus 16:14 ff.
and the striking of water from the rock (not present here) with the typology of the Passion of Christ with the flesh and blood of the communion.
.PP
The saints in the Sacra Conversazione are identified by their attributes,
and the central position of St.
Catherine strengthens the attribution to Utrecht,
although in fact the manuscript was produced in Bruges.

(ff. 1r:16-4v and 6r-v) The passages are from chapter 14 (Περὶ ὑπακοῆς ), giving us XIV.1 - XIV.22 (last one incomplete and begins def.: ἕως οὐ κἀγὼ ἀνταμήνομαι αὐτῷ.
καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ γέ[ρων]), latter part of XIV.28 (begins def.: στυγνὸς εἶ;
καὶ διηγήσατο τῷ πατρὶ ὅτι τρία παιδία ἔχω ), XIV.29, and the beginning of XIV.30 (ends def.: γένῃ μοναχός.
καὶ ἀπελθὼν εὗρεν ἀπὸ σημείου ἑνὸς καὶ ἐποίη[σε] ). The attributions,
when compared with the Collectio alphabetico-anonyma,
are as follows:
XIV.1=Antonios 36;
XIV.2=Arsenios 24;
XIV.3=Ares 1;
XIV.4=Ioannes Kolobos 1;
XIV.5=Ioannes,
disciple of Paulos 1;
XIV.6 - 9 Moïses (XIV.9=Mios 1); XIV.10 Megethios;
XIV.11=Markos Silvanos 1;
XIV.12=Markos Silvanos 3;
XIV.13=Poimen 109;
XIV.14=Pambo 3;
XIV.15=Sisoes 10;
XIV.16=Sopatros 1;
XIV.17=Synkletikos 16;
XIV.18=Synkletikos 17;
XIV.19=Hyperechios 8;
XIV.20-21 correspond with the anonymous N290,
N388 (F. Nau, op. cit., ROC 14 (1909) p. 376, and 18 (1913) p. 143); XIV.22 has no correspondent in the Collectio alphabetico-anonyma,
but is included in Guy’s account (J. C. Guy, Recherches sur la tradition grecque des Apophtegmata Patrum,
2e éd.
avec des compléments,
Subsidia Hagiographica 36,
Bruxelles 1984). This also holds for XIV.6 - 8 and XIV.10 above.
XIV.28 =N295; XIV.29 =N296=Roufos 2 (cf. F. Nau, op. cit., ROC 14 (1909) p. 378f.); XIV.30 =Heraklios 1.
A comparison of Medeltidshandskrift 54 with J.
C. Guy’s investigation of the ms tradition gives few clues as to where to locate our manuscript:
one can observe that only the mss V,
R and Y contain the whole body of apophtegms from XIII.17 to XIV.30, the mss T and Q containing all but one (XIV.8 and XIV.9 respectively). The apophtegms V.20-21 are joint together into one single saying in the manuscripts PJ,
M, and T.
That point of comparison is not available for the mss V and Q in their mutilated state - they both lack the first nine chapters.
As to Guy’s grouping of the systematic collections into three different phases of development (états), one can only establish that Mh54 belongs to either état b or état c,
i.e. it is clearly classified amongst the mss which compared to the 6th c.
Latin version by Pelagius and John (siglum PJ;
the text is reproduced in Migne,
PL 73,
855-1022 and 1060-1062) have been enlarged with roundabout 75 apophtegms,
but it may belong to the even richer version (with about 85 further additions): since the text stops in the middle of XIV.30 we cannot know if this entry was followed by two more originally.

Accents are sometimes put not over the vowel but over the next letter.
Nomina sacra mostly without accents.
Medeltidshandskrift 54 is possibly a product by the same - unknown - scribe who wrote the Codex Sinaiticus Graecus 364.
That codex has a clear connection to the Mangana monastery in Constantinople,
founded by Constantine IX Monomachos in 1042,
which could in turn,
at least tentatively,
give us an approximate time and place for the origin also of Medeltidshandskift 54 (for Cod.
Sin. Gr. 364 see D.
Harlfinger et al., Specimina Sinaitica,
Berlin 1983,
pp. 23-25 and Taf.

Foliation

Foliation (in upper corner) and pagination (in lower corner) are both modern and made with pencil.The ordering of the leaves has become confused in the binding process:
f. 7 should have come before f.
1; between f.
4v and f.6r there is a loss of text probably equivalent to 2 leaves;
f. 5 is a separate fragment coming from another part of the same codex.
The restored order would accordingly be:
5. 7. 1. 2. 3. 4. 6.

Marginal entries:
F. Iv abstract from A.
Deissmann's brief description of the fragment,
which he gives in a letter sent to the rector at the University of Lund.
The letter,
dated 12.
Dec. 1920,
still accompanies the codex as a loose-leaf. F. IIr owner's signature:
Adolf Deissmann Athen 1906,
and a dedicatory note written by the same owner.
F. 1v (upper outer corner) a monokondylion in black ink saying makario~. F. 5v a prayer formula in upper margin in pale brown ink;
in the outer margin a note probably in the same hand,
which due to cutting and fading is difficult to decipher.
F. 6v (lower margin) in loud violet ink a note which seems to mention the year of 1899.

Condition
.small
.PP
The parchment,
originally of good quality,
is now discoloured and worn.
That f.
6v och 7r used to make up the exterior of this fragment can be seen from the wear,
which partially has made the text hard to discern;
on f. 6v one can see the wearing marks from string.
The upper corners of f.
6 and 7 are torn.
The leaves are coarsely joined together with woven adhesive tape,
the same tape was utilized for mending a number of rips,
especially on f.

The former owner,

According to the seller they originated from a monastery on the Peloponnese.
Deissman had it rebound in Germany.

The book was donated by Deissmann to the University Library of Lund as an expression of his gratitude towards friends and colleagues in Scania for their hospitality (Lunds universitets årsredogörelse,

\fBCollation\fR: Collation is disturbed due to the rebounding of the manuscript and the restoration of the leaves in the 1980s.
However the quires are generally quaternions.
No catchwords or quire signatures.
The manuscript contains a number of added leaves from different periods (presumably up till 18th century): f. 2a (between ff.
2 and 3,
±181x59 mm), p. 135a (attached to f.
65r, 180x40 mm), f. 75a (between ff.
74 and 75,
220x139 mm), f. 298 (see the watermark,
the leaf is attached to f.
297, ±334x 246 mm), f. 332 (see the watermark,
the leaf is attached to f.
333, ±345x260 mm), ff. 465-468 (7 leaves foliated I-VII, see the watermark,
p. I - in fragments,
glued on modern paper under the restoration of the MS,
writing only on one side,
±320x195 mm). Ff. 75a, 465-468 (I-VII) have been glued directly on the original leaves (ff. 75r, 428r-431r) and taken off during the rebinding of the MS,
the leaves contain glue marks.
.IP "" \n[PI]u
\fBLayout:\fR Ruling in hard point filled with pencil;
only in pencil on the attached leaves.
The layout is homogeneous throughout practically the whole manuscript:
1 column,
8 lines and music,
with exception for ff.
455r-457v: 1 column,
12-14 lines and music;
and ff.
459r - 464v:
2 columns,
23 lines.

\fBScript:\fR Textualis Quadratus,
Textualis Semiquadratus.
Roman square note script.
Four hands.
Hand 1 on ff.
1-427v (inc: hominum simul in unum;
expl: christo domino evovae); hand 2 on ff.
428r-457v? (rubric:
Per totum adventum.
ad tertiam ymnus;
inc: Conditor alme syderum;
expl: que sola virgo parturit?); hand 3 on ff.
458r-v (inc: hec vota clemens accipe;
expl: Deus creator omnium); hand 4 on ff.
459r-464v (rubric:
Dominicis diebus;
inc: Domine miserere nostri;
expl: iherusalem laudem in terra). The script on the added leaves (ff. 75a, 298v and 332r-v as well as on the small slip paginated 135a) is similar to Antiqua typeface or Humanistic minuscule (no abbreviations). The script on leaves 465r-468r has the similar appearance but contains a great number of abbreviations.
The script on the slip f.
2a-v is in a later hand.

History

Origin
.small
.PP
The MS originates most probably from a Benedictine nun monastery called Ghislenghien,
1126-1796, situated in Hagenau province in Flanders,
between the towns of Enghien and Ath.
Judging from the addendum in the text,
watermarks on the added leaves and so on,
the MS has been in use until the 18th century.
.big
.SH
.ft I
Provenance
.small
.PP
Note in the centre of the upper flyleaf:
Heberles Cat.
? LXXIV ,
probably made in the period after the MS had left the monastery and before it came to Sweden.
In upper right corner of the upper flyleaf:
Gustaf Noring 1877 ;
in pencil below (unidentified hand) = numera Ali Nuri Bey,
muhamedan.
Turk. generalkonsul i Rotterdam,
föll i onåd hos sultanen och förvisades till mindre Asien 1899(?) . Gustaf Noring (b. 1861 (according to other sources 1858) - d. 1937) was a Swedish book collector from Malmö,
who immigrated to Turkey in 1879,
became a Turkish diplomat,
embraced Islam and changed his name to Ali Nouri Bey.
According to what he says in his own book ("Ur gamla gömmor,
En gärd åt det förflutna af Ali Nouri", Malmö Tidning 1902 8/4, printed in 20 copies,
see Carlander C.M. "Svenska bibliotek och exlibris", Stockholm 1904,
pp. 429-30, 760-61) Noring had a book collection of about 5000 volumes by the time he left Sweden at the age of 16 (or 19). In 1879 part of his collection was sold.
This manuscript was probably among the sold books.
The manuscript appears in catalogues from Quidings Antiqvariat (Lund) from 1883 (Katalog ?
3. Teologi och Kyrkohistoria,
#442, priced at 75 Swedish crowns) and from 1886 (Katalog ?
11. Teologi och Kyrkohistoria,
#1734, priced at 50 Swedish crowns). It is not included in the next catalogue (December 1891).

The manuscript belongs to the family M* of H.
Delehaye's survey,
cols. XXXVIII - XLVI.
The brevity of Delehaye's manuscript descriptions makes it difficult to establish the place of Medeltidshandskrift 57 within the M*-group,
but it seems reasonable to suppose a close affinity between Mh 57 and the manuscript Ma (Codex bibliothecae Caesaraeae Petropolitanae gr.
231).

The parchment is now very dark and wrinkled but seems to have been of good quality originally.
Probably 12th century.
Writing area 205/210 x 145 mm.
Ruling type Sautel 22D1 (or possibly 22C1,
it is difficult to see,
due to cutting of the inner margin). Dark brown ink,
mixed minuscule script pendent from ruled lines.
The text comes from another synaxarion and gives part of the text for May 9 and 10,
mentioning the saints

\&. The wording of the narrative on Kodras suggests that the fragment could be related to the ms D (Codex bibliothecae Nationalis Parisiensis 1587) of H.
Delehaye's study in Synaxarium Ecclesiae Constantinopolitanae,
Bruxelles 1902 (Acta Sanctorum,
Propylaeum ad Acta SS.
Novembris). The ms is mutilated at the end,
giving just two entries on the 27th of February and none for the 28th.
Quire numbering is made in Greek numerals in two sets successively:
quires 1-21 and 22-38. The signatures are generally written (by the main scribes,
it seems,
or at least in the same ink as the rest of the text) in the lower righthand corners of first recto and last verso for quires no.
2 - 21, in the middle of or the outer corners of lower margin for quires no.
22 - 37. Some signatures are missing altogether,
a few of them probably trimmed away or lost due to ripping of the page.
Although originally made up of quaterniones the bookblock is now bound together in much larger units.
To prevent the well used book from falling apart one has at rebinding taken some 18-20 leaves at a time,
overcasting them tightly at the spine.
Thus the binding threads which are visible inside these units cannot be taken as proof of an irregular quire organisation,
and accordingly the old quire signatures are still valid.

\fBScript:\fR The manuscript was copied by two contemporary scribes,
scribe A wrote ff.
1-161, scribe B ff.
162-297. Only on f.
191v a third hand seems to appear.
None of them are as yet identified.
No subscription is preserved,
since the final leaves are lost.
The script of the first part of the manuscript is clear and regular,
slightly inclined to the left.
A prominent feature of the script is the forceful pen strokes at the base of the letters ξ and ζ ending in a NW-SE-diagonal,
which is also taken up by χ ,
λ , and δ.
Note also the shorthand και linked to next letter,
further the rather conspicuous - ος ligatures as in πρò at the end of lines (cf. f. 102r). Though coming from a skilled hand the style gives rather an uncouth impression.
Blackish-brown and mild orange-red ink in good preservation.
The second part of the manuscript (ff. 162-297) shows more of a scholar's hand.
It is upright or very slightly inclined to the right.
Brown and light red ink,
the latter in a strongly faded condition.
The large thetas and omegas dominate the script together with other overdimensioned circular forms in e.g. α, ο, and φ ('Fettaugenmode'). At the end of lines the punctuation marks are sometimes inscribed within the spacious C-sigma,
omicron or upsilon.
.big
.SH
.ft I
Decoration
.small
.PP
Head pieces,
tituli and most of the other decorative elements are in faded red ink - some linefillers and elaborate initials combine black and red ink.
The headpieces for September,
October,
and November,
height 30-40 mm,
are in Laubsägestil;
the rectangular frame contains a billowy arabesque with halfpalmettes and knobs,
lily- or palmette shaped corner decorations,
and, in the middle of the top border,
a threefold loop or Dreierschlinge (fully worked out in the September piece,
only suggested in the following two). The red ink is used for contouring but also for filling up the background (Aussparungstechnik). The headpieces for the following three months show a Flechtband-construction in the form of a ribbon interlacedly crossing itself while passing through ribbon ovals.
The ends of the ribbon are shaped as lilies.
At the end of each day in the synaxarion we find a delimiting linefiller,
the design of which in the first half of the book (=scribe A) varies considerably,
while in the second half scribe B has kept to a more restricted set of rather simple geometrical/vegetal ornaments.
This contrast between the two scribes is reflected also in the design of the initials.
Elaborate red (occasionally red and black) initials project into the margin and in the space between the two columns at the outset of all narratives.
On ff.
1-161 the oblong initials,
20-45 mm.
in size,
show two basic structures:
the unfilled Laubsäge/Palmetten type and the filled silhouette/bead-and-reel type with additional embellishments of beads and strokes.
There are some examples of zoomorphic initials and linefillers,
chiefly single or double snakes (ff. 19r ,
29v , 34v ,
61v , 68v ,
108v ,
112v ,
120v ,
142v ,
159v ). Two fish-initials (omicron), on f.
78r and f.
89v . >From f.
162 onwards the initials are quite plain and of lesser dimensions (height 10-20mm). The elaboration is often just a couple of swellings and a small beaded tendril at the base.
Rubrication is also used for the commemoration of each saint,
i.e. for the opening remark which sometimes stands alone but mostly precedes the ensuing verse(s) and the narrative of the saint.
Furthermore,
all iambic or hexametral lines are indicated by small majuscule or minuscule initials in red.

Binding

Blind-tooled dark brown goatskin binding,
preserved covers of Byzantine binding;
Greece,
contemporary with the manuscript.
Rebinding,
20th century.
Size: 310 x 225 x 95 mm.
.PP
Dark brown goatskin binding over thick,
grooved,
square edged wooden boards with rounded inner face at the spine (type a and k,
cfr. Szirmai 1999,
p. 75; type 19.5 and 20.3, cfr. Frederici and Houlis 1988 p.
28). Rebinding with upper cover and back of black calfskin and with lower cover from former binding.
Dark brown covering material of upper board and back from former binding preserved,
but partly missing on the new covering.
Small white paper label with the number 793 at the centre of the upper cover.
Two fastenings at fore-edge missing (holes at lower cover fore-edge type 32.4, cfr. Frederici and Houlis 1988,
p. 39). Rounded spine with lining of blue grey cloth.
Tight back.
Blind-tooled white library cloth label at the top of the back.
Natural coloured primary endbands embroidered on double supports extending over the boards.
The endbands are attached by the sewing thread by several holes on the inner face of each board (fig. 6.10, cfr. Szirmai 1999,
p. 77; fig. 26.3, cfr. Frederici and Houlis 1988,
p. 35). The endbands are restored and partly damaged.
Former edge trimming preserved.
No squares.
One plain paper flyleaf,
20th century,
mounted on the first and last manuscript page of the bookblock.
Upper board with a half paper pastedown;
on the inside of the upper board in black ink:
Cυναξάριν ςʹ μην(ων) | σεπτεμβ(ριος) ε(ως) φεβ(ρουαριου) and on the inside of the lower board,
rather coarsely:
πε μα ‚αφ ασπρ(ων) | ͵ςσο ασπρ(ων) | χρεω | τό λγθετϊ.
The original (most likely link-stitch) sewing on three sewing stations is repaired by assembling and oversewing leaves into thick gatherings of 18 to 20 leaves each.
The original sewing thread is broken at joints but remains in holes of the boards and in centrefolds of the gatherings.
The covers are blind-tooled to a frame of double fillets containing two rows of a repeated rectangular stamp with heart-shaped forms (cfr. Vat. gr. 1297,
cfr. Frederici and Houlis 1988,
p. 56). The central panel is divided into four compartments each divided by fillets into a saltire.
(fig. 37.6, cfr. Federici and Houlis 1988,
p. 66). The fillets of the compartments are stamped with a small four-petal flower and the concurrences of the fillets with a tool of concentric circles.
The compartments of the lower cover are decorated with a symmetric trapeze-shaped tool showing a lily on a blind bottom and the upper cover compartments with a circular tool possibly of a two-headed eagle.
The back is blind-tooled with a double fillet to a fishbone pattern with concentric circles at the top of each superposed and inversed V-form.

Condition

.PP
Overall the manuscript is in fairly good condition.
There are some traces of worm and water damage,
and especially the red ink of the latter scribe has undergone severe fading and can be read only with difficulty.
Wax stains and overcasting along the inner margin give evidence to the frequent use of the codex.

It was donated to the Lund University Library the following year (cfr. Lunds universitets årsredogörelse,

Origin
.small
.PP
Written in Tikrit 1204/5 by the scribe Mattai,
son of Johannan;
revised in 1795/6 by Johannan the Sinner (cf. ff. 3r , 205v ,
308r and 324r ).

Provenance
.small
.PP
The manuscript was owned by Abd Jeschu bar Abraham who has written in the margin both in Arabic and in Syriac.
According to a note on f.
38r he bought the book in 1634/5 from an Arab for 3 piasters.
In another note he calls himself Diaconus and writes Arabic with Syriac letters (see f.
255r ). Another owner seems to have been a certain Rabbi' of Tikrit who bought the book for five denari.
He writes only in Arabic (see e.g. f. 106r ). How the manuscript came to Europe is not known.

  How and when the manuscript came to Kalmar is not known. In the 16th century it was still in Vadstena but was possibly brought to Kalmar in 1595 when the convent was dissolved. It appears 1876 in Melén's "Förteckning öfver Kalmar H. Elementarläroverks Boksamling" (Kalmar, 1876, p. 209). Since 1990, June 12, it is in deposition at Lund University Library.
