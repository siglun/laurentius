8 (ff. 118-125), XIX: 8 (ff. 126-133), XX: 8 (ff. 134-141), XXI: 8 (ff. 142-149). Quire signatures in lower margin of last leaf of all quires;
sometimes cropped.
The amount of missing text from the first quires (cfr. above) corresponds to a loss of the outer bifolium of the quire.
Apart from this loss,
the remaining loop of sewing thread and fragments of parchment still visible behind two supports,
indicate the loss of another,
unsigned,
quire consisting of a single bifolium.
Since the writing space required for the text of the first psalm,
including a large B-initial,
and the beginning of the second is supplied by the missing first folio of the first preserved quire,
the superfluous amount of leaves provided by the extra bifolium would have sufficed to use the first leaf as pastedown,
leaving one folio for prefaces or decorations.
One quire is missing between f.75 and f.
76. The text ends corruptly on f.
149v and fragments of sewing hamp indicate the loss of one quire,
probably a single bifolium.

Decoration
.small
.PP
In linea marks?
with leaf ornaments on ff.
1v, 2r, 5r, 5v, 6v, 7r, 11r, 12r, 13r, 13v, 17v, 22r, 23v, 26r, 27v, 30r, 30v, 32r, 32v, 35v, 49r, 53r, 54v, 93r, 94r, 134r,
138r, 143r,
mostly very simple,
but the ornament on f.
7r is somewhat more elaborate,
though not enough to indicate any specific place of origin.
The 155 initials,
in red ink with a few exceptions in green and red with green details,
are simple but not without elegance in the curvature and sometimes decorated with small leaves and flower buds.
Generally the initials are in uncial,
but there are a few square initials,
and especially E and F usually display a blend of the two forms.
.PP
Secondary enhancements in light brown ink with floral ornaments and geometrical designs on ff.
4r, 69r, 76r, 110r,
117v, 136r and 137r are most probably Scandinavian,
dating from the 13th or beginning of the 14th century (cfr. Medeltidshandskrift 10;
the same reader?); f. 68v :
the light brown outline of a bearded face in profile in the left margin marking a section of the commentary,
contemporary with the enhancements of the initials;
f. 124r :
simple outline of a face in profile in light brown ink lower right margin marking a section of the commentary,
contemporary with the enhancements of the initials.
It simpler than the face on f.
68v , but undoubtedly by the same hand.
