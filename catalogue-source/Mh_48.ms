Style:
The diagrams,
probably executed by the scribe Paulus zighanus in 1444,
do not produce any significant stylistic features leading to the geographical origin of the manuscript.
The decorated initial on f.
60v , however,
shows typically Italian leaf forms.
The secondary note on f.
88v , which indicates a provenance at some date at Genova,
together with the watermark,
suggests a north Italian origin.
